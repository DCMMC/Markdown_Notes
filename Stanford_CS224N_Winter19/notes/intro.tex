\chapter{About this Note} \label{sec:intro}

Note that most of symbols in this note are vector, matrix, or tensor.
Strictly speaking, we should write them as bold to differ from scalars.
But for simplification, most bolds of them are ignored in this note.

Also, $\times$ in superscript will leads into overflow in this latex source code.
Therefore, all $\times$ are replaced by $*$ in superscripts.

When there is no possibility for confusion, we write the propability $Pr(W = w)$ where $W$ is the random variable and $w$ is the specific value to the shorthands $P(w)$.
