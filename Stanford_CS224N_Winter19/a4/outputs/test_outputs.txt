You know what I do is I write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for the kids read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can do it as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that landed in some place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in the middle school, which I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom room.
It was doing it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years I was thinking, I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never come to us.
You could get it to Ohio and please bring that man to you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, I would like you to go with it, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We were going to see it <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and we take care of their family, because it was needed, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was made in the present itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I have been talking very much about this.
It also needs -- you need dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them down to my <unk> about 60 feet -- and I couldn't more than thinking about it was a <unk> on another <unk> a year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to <unk> and hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and separated and alone, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts as a <unk> I am breathing out your atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts as a iceberg released fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was out of the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't exist at that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures that I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that photographed at <unk> Greenland.
Is it a little bit frequent to really get to be a <unk> iceberg to actually be able to see.
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a five-minute iceberg in average.
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so it <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> <unk>
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception I don't get attention to it.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in an case, the sperm and sperm comes into the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the sperm X of the sperm is attached to the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity of the ground on the ground of two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way that people are going to have the anatomy -- and we have human bodies to say, how have the fluid fluids and the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features, challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physics typology is not fit in the male <unk> and conventional feminine <unk>
In the general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't fit into the common or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the guy with <unk> <unk> which is whose gene <unk> of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in <unk> life that became <unk>
And then, in the life of life, the testicles have testosterone.
But because this individual lacks <unk> the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high school levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops by following a <unk> course.
When I <unk> the baby has a little bit of a little girl.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not yet until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
Then of making tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, like men, we have in the body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, don't know his structure -- I think to be a typical majority of women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a <unk> <unk> and born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, he had girlfriend, he had a life as a kid, and I had just discovered that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- <unk> glands were as active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormonal component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that in fact was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with quantum chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- they have tissue <unk> wrapped in solid tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- we have to be <unk> twins, or <unk> are <unk> to <unk> surgeries, and not to be able to have a better physical health with.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is basically based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is being a woman to have a <unk> identity -- it will be black to say to have African anatomy in ancient terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very sensitive ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very Romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people inside a body.
The biggest biggest case is last year with the <unk> African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What do you test are going to be able to determine whether it's <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there's no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science -- the more we need to admit that these categories -- that we thought were made of stable sustainable categories that will be used directly to <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the Copernican terminology is.
And as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you think about it in just a few <unk>
And as we go back in science we get more and more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at beginning and end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very low discussions today -- it's not in public, but within <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to get involved with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of your nose and if he moved it yet.
If I stopped moving it down.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body, and put it into another body.
And as a result, we need to address a dilemma of determining death, and that puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
And in politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
<unk> that these categories are far more fragile than we thought we thought about it.
It was <unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan, of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find myself so much watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
Parents <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
And what they would say was a <unk> concept, and we did it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our parents -- <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
It was the idea of the idea that the political power was coming to the political power passed from grandfather to father and then the son, and so on.
The parents -- <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And in part of the things they were doing because they're part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the Parents -- that many people were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the Afghan explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed away from a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at you, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> coincidence.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And the women.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement, and he said, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who are going to do a <unk> coincidence about the difference and again, and again, they <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves, why do we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish to the same rights as a human.
I don't mean that we should be anatomy.
I don't want to say that the three-year-old kids should have to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> which for me makes sense and that I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they are, why they are keeping sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary. was born three months before the June 1 in 1980.
Now, Henry, at the contrary, was born in term: was born last March of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before to Henry -- the right to sex consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that wasn't because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't worry about.
Mary.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy of it.
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people have caught up in a strange position.
For example: Texas has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have a chromosome and to marry a woman to marry a woman and have a <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests for people with people.
But this is also very strange that the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty one."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to engage with rights to people, because I will admit that yes of some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more the social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> I know can make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me is what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to do that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to lead this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to submit to a change of sex, in which case you can be able to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had made light twins, so they were going to pick up, and then they <unk> their fame.
But when I was asked by the phone I asked him the meaning of the operation, he was very <unk> he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered to look at political asylum rather than the separation of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people who are not <unk> to change for the sake of state.
So I think we need to be in your head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is differences between men and women in terms of thinking and working in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was interested as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there is nothing <unk> on the <unk>
But the more I thought about her question, the more I think there is something female <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers were, they were very excited to find a way to protect people from the state, it's possible that we have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond the individual <unk> to think less in your individual body, in terms of your identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think of where every family is thinking to live and work, has the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their construction cost.
So we could easily go back to the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just put it through buildings of apartments.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments would be owners and that the other half is not going to be no longer to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and the building distractions that the building is.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place, building a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place in which we built the construction instead of putting them down.
So I proposed that the governments of the new reform governments are large enough to contain cities and gave them an name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 dollars would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next elections we were <unk> <unk> <unk> a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a TED talk.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, as those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents in apartments.
We get a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies such as <unk> rules and usually are the rules that prevent us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link to the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They call.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> terrain that, in some cases, worth per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion -- and at some point, when there was a <unk> pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which will <unk> the rules that are going on there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go to or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going on.
He was asked to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this explained what a new city can be able to offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city where they might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North Pole.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the U.S. government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them set up and to fulfill the rules of <unk> so that they could all be confident that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This photo is there.
It could easily have a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special special regions.
In a country that was just going through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To make it on the Constitution -- it has to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 was passed on another voting on <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on 24 in February, an shifting of about 30 <unk> is going to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new large city center that is being built in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after that was four years to get the <unk>
The other country in the building is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> that's the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to go and allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be ultimately for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies that would like to move into the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to come immediately somewhere else.
There's a million to the year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get work to get work -- sometimes they are solitary mothers who have to earn money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are the kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what inside, I'm going to make a public confession with it, and that's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, to photograph and publish on my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
So what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I will like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I think about for this exciting week at TED.
That is, what brings someone out of that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
I put inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after I get here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know me as a woman walking at TED in inner underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to use no new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
Just yourself.
If you get away from the right people -- not only do you dare you also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play <unk> or I remember her little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inside and outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone to this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people came up to me this week just so I was using it, and we had fantastic conversations.
It's obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave up certain things.
I don't need <unk> to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I get up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
So for example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members in this audience, your brain is something like that, with a big <unk> in both of them <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
And I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need quite logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves playing with them and then we see as a <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As an intuition that you may have developed over the years is that it says that one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, it always gets off.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow them to get them up and stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have from the world, except be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car bars -- play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics a few years ago; you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and perhaps because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit well to my <unk>
Because if it's made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't keep all the principles of quantum mechanics there.
I don't find the reason why they shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit of a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a look at a good approach to the little metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and a springboard and that are coming out on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip. And I started to work all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this sort of <unk> <unk> that's found underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in an quantum overlap but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird, but then when other people go up with doing those things, because I don't want them to hate them, or, in fact, they <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues in the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we put off the air, and we pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way he <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expanding and <unk>
And when I give him a soft thrust, we could make it <unk> and not to go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you, is something really fantastic.
What does that mean?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in particular <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom -- and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was embedded in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we turned it up, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly seemingly all of the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about how much about quantum mechanics says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who's here and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and 18 months old.
A lot of negotiations, and stories, they would be done with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Better than it shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've carried out from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all of the museums there are.
There's gallery gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the Van <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move down there and get <unk>
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We open the plane, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go to the end of the hall, you want.
Keep forward. What was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I've not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows you the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click on there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things really fun that are happening.
I love this guy, your expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to take it off.
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems to be <unk>
And I found that kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which consists of hitting a <unk> with a pole <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get into a deep depth and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you really see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is to come, one second.
So now we're very quickly going to jump at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Gogh Van actually created this <unk> work.
It increases and really <unk> it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts at this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it that before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have any time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online to create your own museum collection out of all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around it.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium, it does justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that they ask me today is, you did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it serious design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, I'm from Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in Formula racing -- one in the last two decades.
Now some time, if you wanted to win a car career, one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car ...
And if the car and the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what we are in engineering -- you have a real time system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond very differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can see, I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the Earth's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects everyday lives.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for late <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
It's kind of like almost all the existing atoms to get sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> and he says that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it into Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you, played Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I got Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at activity happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At late late there are people here and there doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a fast call and go to the bathroom.
Second time, End of time.
First time <unk> second.
And in a moment, the <unk>
wins Italy, yeah!
That night everyone was <unk> to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone was at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody's <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how we can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, and how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're really complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> one day still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came to us and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you have <unk> valves that are opening up and <unk>
It felt like a curtain.
If you fall the pixels to be written on them, showing you patterns, images like that.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the building on the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows, but when you come up to you, it's open to you so that you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears as well.
And there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, go down the roof, someone who said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost every architecture goes down.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> so it goes inside.
And here I am myself trying not to try not to test the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to you to let you happen, but a building that kept doing <unk> and holes of water and one had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels the pixels of water, and from projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, in which what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different kind of guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get close, and look at it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the lights lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an entrance that comes from people, the movement of the people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of Israel today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their own 3D movements, and use them as an entry for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time <unk> as a movement capture.
It can make the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go from the digital world, the power of <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see it from below, I will serve to share the main moments of the London Olympic Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So that's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but most importantly, it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose you told you that, with only a lot of changes in your genes, you could improve the balance for more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better form, be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
What about living with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most important thing to do?
What do you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do we make creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people present.
That's really good.
How many would <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or may be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except for light from <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or us?
This is another look into the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well at one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been perhaps 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here a few years old.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin is not like human insulin -- but it's the same <unk> protein, which comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> does it look at you about <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm in dark, dark, antibodies, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that you can want with no effort on it.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional psychiatric disruption of any rush to the <unk>
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something that maybe <unk> <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life in the Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and a single <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I just went back to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I fell in love with something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in organisms that are simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to two daughters.
But when organisms appear to change things that are starting to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the body's death enters evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well <unk> death for <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that happened, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90s.
And one night someone hits his hotel door to you.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a little <unk> clothes.
You look at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It says, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily a different thing to do.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make us healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted them to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then we would let it fall into the sea.
I think that all of the sense that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution is not necessarily giving longevity.
It doesn't necessarily include the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and even the most smart.
Evolution favors creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that we need, if there were fish there there, fish <unk> <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what this means is, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, instead, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we will tell us so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of traditional traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a <unk> planets are going to exist in isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society to society, but it's what you pick up on the individual and family level.
Just think that if you could choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in its own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
By the next year, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at the cost of 20,000 and a week.
Not much of course, is that the human genome is actually making the human genome for <unk> and being more and more at all.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce <unk>
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against flu <unk> in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good than comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just two other little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give your kids a better chance of a healthier life, remove your diabetes, eliminate your own risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't they live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions that would pass this next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can get it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more uniform or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And what's profound about everything -- we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For evil, and before what could be done -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big blast when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the <unk>
So immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. We probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already been <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
It's mostly not the road.
And the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words that I've heard about.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to switch all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that by the way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I walked the bridge George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought Wow, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my errors I've been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I would argue with things that didn't care about people care about.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as I walked into that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have reason to have reason to be <unk>
And the third thing I learned -- and this is how your mind would be like your mental clock is <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I started, I had the feeling of, Wow, I'll die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sorrow is <unk> in one thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was all of the reason to be in the world.
And at that point I understood those two points of points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing on your plane is going on in your airplane -- please.
What are you going to say is that you still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we have.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
It was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he got to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has complete paralysis, in it.
You can only use your eyes.
His job influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation firm that obviously, graffiti is a <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him, and he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can be able to communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, you will make it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented me with just my wish to deliver a check and instead of that he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to <unk>
I slept with her brother and her father there at the very precise moment, and he said, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony's going to speak -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so much inside your inside cannot be able to do it.
So I talked to a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- they draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around with art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the heart attacks, and in the end, people start making art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that he <unk> could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy gets an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all of the world's corners of all the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the garage behind, and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have removed the frames of the walls and in his place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the shipping walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and they can see the <unk>
This is a couple of <unk> sunlight that we bought in the shipping <unk> walk of the Beach, something <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We took a camera <unk> we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free to free -- and you build yourself -- we published the source code, the software is low in a <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only his eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of teaching sessions from all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran to bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti too.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody was finally coming to <unk> and I would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it is the equivalent of a nanotube.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine acknowledged us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best about all of this -- and this is what ends up by closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the Los Angeles center, is going to have an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
Nothing that there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology simply recognized that, and I got amazing people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like to do. If it's not now <unk> And if I'm not me, who am me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are often very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in complicated and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been messing up in situations in terms of terrible appearance, with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that they see useful and affordable for the audience.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, and some on Twitter, I offered them to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been <unk>
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said before, I've entered horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be <unk> for something so hard or as dangerous as I enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that all the top at the bottom, at beginning to end, has pictures of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes out before the title -- the X <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were going into the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the title, but we're going to make sure we will put all the categories in the film.
Maybe they would take a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe you ever had.
The most great car you've driven in "The biggest car ever <unk> the best drink you have <unk> <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot -- beginning to end.
And I would love to help me make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you are <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it is going to happen.
MS: A million and a half a half and a half -- John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of the movie -- let's look at a lot of <unk> idiots
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to be <unk> by the film or for me.
JK: We both things.
MS: It means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That is <unk> When you look at people who have to <unk>
MK: We have some places to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was going to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to make so much people as possible.
Especially in the world of today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to count with that new vehicle -- it's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
In fact, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>      This is one of the first images that got up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices -- the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the president -- even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to making it actually something changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you <unk> -- like that weird bear that still continues to <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and saying we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want us to be <unk> history.
We want to make it a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and that's him looking at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and there is <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away the proxy to go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to show up all of a sudden -- where I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I've got friends who make big, huge, giant movies, and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make large Hollywood movies say that the reason her movies have so successful it is to the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you get to you."
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then you offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> from <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have a lot of man for man to <unk> solid, to <unk> <unk>
That's the look general.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Yeah. We are a small brand of it.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are pretty much a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk> technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category on positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you cool time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, it <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors, a lot of gray stuff.
Usually I carry it up like sunglasses, or the <unk> or the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: I don't know. In part of the <unk> partly <unk> -- I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.
We inspected toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> brand.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand of Tom, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you can surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: So that world is -- I think your world is the world that you want, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case come from and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next thing is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things. I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> so what do we do that?
What's the <unk> What phase you find right now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great Marshall Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to look at this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but it turns out in your personality, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think a few companies are only going to become one of your strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to prevent the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually make them <unk> and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands like this?
The first here is classic classic Apple.
And you can see it also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and you know, those things that have gone and come and come and come up but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If somebody asks you to raise your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're an <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being playful like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or audacious as <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> or <unk> or mystical or <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're conscious of a sophisticated <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, relative, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing like film.
We went to San Paulo where they're forbidden into the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going on way in the way schools with money issues in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I've ever been most successful are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what they did these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to challenge people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They went back.
Well, since the movie is released in <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million of impressions in the media for this film.
This is about just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong with all the agencies that we talk about to give them to their clients not being part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that's in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees on loss <unk> it's preparing their entire company to reward them for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at a time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to get to transparency.
Today, more than a little bit honesty is going to go along a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> <unk> the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the name of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> great data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED matrix -- the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real control systems.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a whole bunch of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus of Windows on a laptop computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a basic <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk>
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems of control.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we went through our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they got very odd things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab in lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And then from experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actually looking in in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that's called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a power plant of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled it up and mapped the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two motor bombs a small and a big.
We also saw that they were very <unk> <unk> for people who obviously had all of the internal information.
We all have the points to attack.
You probably even know how much to break the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this source code.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and structures of data and tried to get it out of the real world, with the potential world of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went into an effort to <unk> their experience with code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
So rotor it's that part of the <unk> that little black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to get back to the nest engineers so that they could not solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started studying scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That was a coincidence.
And it was even better.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had in between hands.
For no <unk> it wasn't like that.
The results have been coming out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital digital <unk> would like one and <unk> but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about the other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, and I really loved it.
There is the gray box, and the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the entry values for example, of the sensors for example, of pressure sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, these fake entry data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up.
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the comparison room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes on speed, you have to open <unk> tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And not the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
It will be as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what you do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences and the better we start to make now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public done on many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in a way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give them a <unk> abilities, or another thing that makes a wheelchair users get up and go walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that goes in in the morning, gives you a big strength, which is also increasing its speed, and help him for example, drive the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on working with talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back to a <unk> load of <unk> and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give it 90 kilos of terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I think what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs on the wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are <unk> million people about <unk> chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, and so young people with the damage to the 20, 20, 30 or 40 years or 40 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talked about the population that comes down to rapidly multiply it quickly.
Their only choice, many times -- for a brain injury or something else.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was in 19 years ago had a injury in the neocortical column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to you on board, here on the back.
There is a few batteries that give the motors into the <unk> and on the knees and on the knees, and they make it progress with this smooth and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing in the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the movement from <unk> down.
Shortly later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole me up to the last glimpse of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding on a hand.
But haven't invented anything that would allow me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: You can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just from soldiers, but to Amanda, and all of the users of chairs from the wheels, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of the bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives alive.
That means we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big <unk> <unk> society is in charge of female females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Amazon <unk> and it has been very difficult to get off.
The Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario in the stage of a violent conflict that has taken over for decades, and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also going to put in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> of hunting and deforestation makes you not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and in chaos, you can hear the laughter by hidden laughter, the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes -- the love, not the <unk> -- because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
As humans, as humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
With him, we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of ideas, diversity of behaviors -- diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo sees the roots of the roots of laughter, the dance and the human ritual, and the human.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from just covered in the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here's a female and a young male male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what he is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case I love him, right?
Yeah.
So sex play is common as well as as well as humans.
And this video is really interesting because we put this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> it and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where he was being <unk>
And I want you to tell you, this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a kind of a <unk> water.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But do we get the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate game play, you can be the moments in which the most urgent thing is.
So <unk> <unk> we accept we accept this gift of evolution and play together as they lay creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are required to a highly qualified staff -- one has to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer I had just gotten before I, <unk> <unk> <unk>  first came to the captain of the captain and he asked him to go up and would save the dog's owner of the owner of the owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I entered a burning building to save a live <unk> just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen that was on that height or less had dropped out the fire and walked into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back up the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house to the house of the house where, as they would expect, his treasure. received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the house from the house of <unk> by the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer <unk> I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or they are by making them -- they are by making it remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you're going right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood.
It's mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So I trained to <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of concrete of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings or bridges a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it was this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> brick came to every home.
It's estimated that more than 400 billion or 75 to a person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block just in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks in stacked of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create a lot greater circuits and more complex a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I would personally think about the building blocks of our time being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'll show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together by magnets.
So you can't put the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue blue with a green and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
One blue with a green one makes light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make <unk> faster or slower -- you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to get up to brick to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given <unk> kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of all the days you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a daylight works, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought back to design schools.
So, for example, designers without experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the University of Rhode Island School of Rhode Island -- they have no experience in engineering -- just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, <unk>
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has fear of darkness.
For these didn't engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go to the website, you would download all the design files and you can see it.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for involved with the environment focused on the environment.
collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit on <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
solar technology is ...
Oh, the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, and we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like about <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year, and we put them work with <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World we send them to the wild <unk> world.
They had great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a date, but what really looks for is that someone is caught by the snow when it's caught by snow, because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask help this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment <unk> a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> in sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made as a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put one name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a big uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends viral shape.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> work in the tsunami, but people <unk>
That's why I ask the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So we now know nine cities that are using using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this is not happening.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people over two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by the normal channels that would have taken at least two and a few million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
There is now a project in the middle of California where the moment has left, 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has a couple of days on a couple of days, and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of shot shot into the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
Nor do we like a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, no constraints, in the open and <unk> manner.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They've not been given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration at that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they give us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they are alone not <unk>
Now many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately made out of -- remember that <unk> <unk> the way of thinking about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of your phone care center and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> <unk>
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put it very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston has no center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
It doesn't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really came up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I walked into the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
And I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to become <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected two people.
And I could have had it connected to the government services of being needed, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are going to, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a political leader, we sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will destroy our values and make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an ocean, and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
It's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us in that part that we funded as something that operates on our against, that other thing, and a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens of citizens who have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the asked of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's kind of financial activism.
And for those of us who have been focused on the government, it's time to ask ourselves, what world we want to leave to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that we face.
Do you really think we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without the government, we can't do it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, I am a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk to them, they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when we face the problem with the government that we don't really care about trying to hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the work to program to program applications that do better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out of a garbage inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government we pay for tax and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, in prisons.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here has impact on the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough -- it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery at Virginia about <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so strong that I could barely breathe, and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> he was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was going back again, and if I said yes, I was allowed to be <unk>
He had this human quality that makes you always want to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins was running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at him and I was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took my hand and said, "Come on. We are both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't get it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things: Three things.
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell you, is that you always want your mother."
I was <unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I always <unk>
As I was <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell you, is that we're always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like that.
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have a brother a older year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just got to make the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he took my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I looked at it with force and <unk> "Oh, you're not still thinking about conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I'm saying it by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others who really don't see sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner on the <unk>
My guys died from age-related diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
There were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million today.
In America we have the largest <unk> rate of <unk>
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, for these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or <unk>
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, French Philadelphia, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in the color are in jail or for parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but it's wealth which affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems of us.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work with some pretty curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you get rid of rights forever if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years the loss of loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where you reported to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without the possibility of leaving ever.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a sense of sense, you think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by drug crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine people, <unk> people have identified an innocent which is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A rate of error, an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't ever be allowed by flying airplanes if every nine you would have <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I'm talking about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what he defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you pick up and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you pick up and make people stop saying that in our history, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went out, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All the time <unk> one with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about it, I think it's because we're not willing to engage you with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> we don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we are intentional and <unk> to give us to <unk>
I think about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it off.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> that will never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. It's even <unk> as rational as it was <unk>
With innovation, the development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, counseling for spirit, a will for being in the world of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay for due attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege of being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were gathered just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I was called me to go, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and get <unk>
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
And so I was going to go and just <unk> them.
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks Parks led to me and said, "Now, let's tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
And I gave it all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> me on the face of the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much but really <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find a way to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody said a lie, isn't because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in people that must be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our design or our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end of the end, the character of a society is not because of the way we treat rich and powerful <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I get too much power.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison, and I see my customers 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who is not it?
The judge is going on as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late I was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer a little, black black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> which said, <unk> so that my 14-year-old black customer is treated as a privileged <unk> <unk> executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I found that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> behavior and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical but a lack of ethics.
In the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, I was not only <unk> I had sent it to the cut.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I came up with me and I was <unk>
And I was excited about the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, I went to her, and we started anger.
People started to go. Everybody was <unk>
I was that I had written those <unk>
They got the cops the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. They were all mad because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> which I was going and <unk>
I would look down the window and get it to hear all that <unk>
I was walking around here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with a concern, of concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the press table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would take a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had gone in the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up and looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> <unk> to tell this young man to keep her view in the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell me to hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, of this community, to help in your hopes to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to that.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring, in which you will make an effort to address the funds that are spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of homicide in homicide and not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> to make the law, to safety.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think that is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> has remained relatively stable.
The huge growth in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong question, war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic rise is happening in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes. We have three legal causes to bring people to supply chain from stealing a bicycle by small crimes against property instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've really excited about <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing is more important to survive, the first stop of all of these data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So of a <unk> of stories would look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news, seven days, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be worse in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps a huge progress conducted in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of the species, the scarcity of water and <unk> we certainly have them.
As human beings are very good at overcoming the problems, and we have just done with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> income per capita income for inflation, has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality is reduced by 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> who global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are going to do it.
And we continue to find more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> <unk> mobile lungs, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the past, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is technology and then lately, its exponential growth.
My Kurzweil friend of Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price performance at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time in the war and peace in <unk> in the <unk>
It's the result of rapid computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it's going curve up.
The rate of growth growth is increasingly faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> by Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotic printing and its ability to democratize and to distribute personalized production on the whole planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, digital medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw victory on "Jeopardy" with <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this one: <unk> <unk> to Frank <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available to all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, does not mean to create <unk> life for every single living on Earth, it's about creating a life of the possible.
This is about taking this thing that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three of the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
They took to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Center to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as the <unk>
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum thing as cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
Let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 <unk> every 88 minutes.
It's not about sliced but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated <unk> rupees -- rupees or 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we have a abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars by water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft on the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
<unk> a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of it is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is also a hope.
It's a technology that's available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to give me your technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It is capable of generating a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any saltwater <unk> water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke has just recently thought to make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in which that will be, Coke will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation innovation, by this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of the cell in the developing world for 2013.
<unk> that warrior, warrior has better mobile communication in the midst of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And by having a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that the president Clinton was 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
They better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> images, images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the Foundation, which is something called the X X <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the world teams to put these technologies into a mobile device that you speak, and because it has <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there's no doctors, where the payload of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that not <unk> call the <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will happen two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that you add to the global conversation.
What would you want these people?
What would you do? What a <unk> <unk>
And instead of economic collapse. we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Academy and because of the use of impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk> and <unk>
How about some voices never before it.
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What do we learn? These 3,000 billion.
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
Something that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by their passion with a clear goal, they can do things that were <unk> things that before they could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this <unk> teachers, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came around and began to <unk>
And it has been shown that today, the recognition of human patterns is better folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me an enormous trust in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are focused on to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have ahead of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very powerful idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught him a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is at the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: The shift of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned too much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about <unk>
There was <unk> of about 20 <unk> the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he became more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had gone down in half.
I would go to five inches.
It <unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The development development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, you called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the south of China Sea <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
So what we capture was something <unk>
<unk> I now know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of the tiny spots on some of the remains of coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start commercial fisheries.
The bottom line of being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what fishermen are being collected every time they have never fish.
But there was no <unk>
We don't remember.
We put the starting point of starting to a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have biodiversity, biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and you extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the rush of changes.
And at the end of the end of keeping it up to the end of the end of the remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer anymore, or that they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies routinely kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea with big fish.
They get <unk> because they <unk> them.
And over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such a <unk> and so I would look at many fish in this zone -- cannot be used or generally they don't use the scientists, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can play a protected marine area.
Because with the marine areas, we really actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think the arts and cinema maybe can fill in a vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales on <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why is it <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I give, it's Cameron, we do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and look at YouTube videos in a professional fashion.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos are making viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web makes any of us, or our actions, copper together in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can have done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only a small percentage of them is viral receive countless views and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation communities and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this <unk> video outside his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of last summer.
<unk> was not ready to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would go through the video to the woods.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting and <unk> them to a wider audience.
RS:
<unk> shrimp <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, on Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of creators are taking a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big inner joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's that, that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the ancient ones.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, there was a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video go up, just a minute of a minute, just that really unique and unexpected it can figure out how these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit, I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by no circular <unk> but often there are obstacles that get you out circular for the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million watched and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new things that we make creative form.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities in participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Justin started on YouTube.
Don't make permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features -- it's just the means of today, but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> they come into the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so long, friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was so only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girl.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task to escape his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed in <unk> vessel.
All adults, they knew the risks.
The biggest fear was corporations, and rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we first take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty.
I don't remember pirates who came to several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights from the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I finished the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I did -- given by the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb <unk> where the population is comprised of immigrant
Unlike the <unk> suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in an assembly line, working six days, <unk> turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> from <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and it has established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> that he was usually <unk>
Two pairs of average <unk> for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
It's home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and <unk> boys trapped between two worlds.
They looked <unk> and <unk>
And the centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classic <unk> a relentless <unk> of myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of us were getting help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I chose the young Australian young day.
And I was a piece of one piece of the puzzle to another, but its edges don't cooperate.
As a <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited me to talk to sites that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> over the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when we get up the boat.
The "no" never had been an option.
<unk> he said, "You know, you're not going to be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly talking about, the more I was <unk> to speak.
I met people of all the roads in life, many of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized that I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
There was to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is okay to be a unknown, a newly new generation on the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> it can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be wrong, but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a blend of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I would take a small group of people to the <unk> <unk> that cannot be a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They were going to be at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up step.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 was a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused an <unk> to <unk> and bringing the cause her, and a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't have proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower room in the room in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came out and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from <unk> he said.
<unk> have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given that we were and how life built us now -- we can see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk> it easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could want that to look for that.
But I fear the privilege of the easy of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, you can just a brave and the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them a lot, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> today in the fourth row row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the ancient <unk> <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great prince warrior Indian warrior -- he was <unk> he got a bow and a <unk> the floor, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we built was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I had no <unk> to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> of 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling of the mobile feeling that the luxury clocks and the cameras can prevent you from it.
We love our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I was sent to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
He was <unk> books since the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
So put the text with the image of the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to me. I write my name.
And so I became a character from the book.
In many times it comes to a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live with the GPS -- which comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic of childhood, those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always a lot of exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they shine your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole single galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and each world becomes a <unk> that I drag to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points in the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and at the same time.
These are the <unk>
We all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out into the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this ritual of childhood you have to go out and, in an chapter, we would take a picture of a flower and then you get it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This way you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a photo of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
In the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
And in the next book, we then have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video turned on and through an augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plant plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and try it to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are attached to technology and magic and technology come closer to each other.
It <unk> energy energy.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic and that magic love and child love that sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> a conductor of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she stood up a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or perhaps not all of all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale that's very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning <unk> me.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple that every time I got <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when I needed assistance assistance or some urgency to that that, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So each morning, I connect to my scale to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing to happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, but it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some meaningful activity to have more control of their health.
From next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or the other device.
And people are going to go from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back and reclaim the control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges we face -- as the firing of the price of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients with the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video video.
We all have shipping controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one is <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please be <unk> by <unk> where, and when it's open, they sometimes open up at <unk> <unk> and they're closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks using his cell phone cell to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to take it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that you can help us find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be <unk> <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please go ahead and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my earlier passion -- but it was a little bit different because I used the camera to the process was in planning.
And when you take a picture of a camera with a camera that comes up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction on a very <unk> road.
But he has a twist on it.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful people, but with the common goal of keeping the U.S.
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want to look like it seems to have been captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it like <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
Hold the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it comes to our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
So I'll show you an easy example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain is not accepts the fact that that really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really actually combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think that are those in which we don't even ignore the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when I combine pictures is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will go to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> you have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible to distinguish the principle and end of the different images with a perfect medium.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs in different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew that I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The <unk> are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even did the red house at the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So in order to achieve a realistic outcome I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you can take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and even very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
And please, if you can <unk>
This is a diagram anybody I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you all the details -- but the overall aspect of it.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
And what's interesting about this is that this one, as many other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we use technological curves at different scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, to see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology as fast as <unk> past, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development -- that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- to look at these <unk> curves. We see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's take one of two things.
Or it will be a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is what is that new way that we take in the world?
So what new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember as a child happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
And a transformation. Can we feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition from <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back a couple of two billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that would spread around it.
If we look at the way that chemical <unk> we give us an idea of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there was some <unk> oil with all sorts of chemical prescriptions inside.
Some of those blobs of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate out the outside of the outside of the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it was <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>
That's why each <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow would be <unk> being better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more and more chemicals and more chemicals and more <unk>
They were mostly living over time, they were more <unk>
It was a new form of life, very simple, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide from the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and would have spread from the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to get communities that in a way, they were together on it, and set up a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community became more and more <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the from the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures to understand and understand the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave you an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning, was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some of the fruit, because I knew bad and sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to one individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most important version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a very complicated idea in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now spend through periods of similar periods to <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape, <unk> tape -- and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where some evolution has been involved with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we have accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that told them took a billion years each.
The next few years, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> language, they took less than a million years.
And the closer on, like electronics, seems to be just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the more you do it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that we work for <unk> would not be possible without the other recent people.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to behave in a conventional fashion.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we have methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, at the top cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million pathways to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those that are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tidy up numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to order to order up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to be some random random sequences of instructions, make them numbers, so none of them did.
But once again, he could see two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they best made the <unk>
And then we get those and <unk> them to the rest.
And now I'm going to show you the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and that children will do the properties of both of these programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Let's get back again.
Some mutations <unk>
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are orders in a perfect perfect way.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
These are strange <unk>
But they do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a hundreds of thousands of programs that we could do it.
In fact, their lives depended on it.
Once he went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls out a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer you a <unk> flight.
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering produces it.
But we don't understand the whole options that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make much faster computers, and so they can run these programs much faster.
I mean, it is <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give me part of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat my talk, talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We are near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of leaving the <unk> talking about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hopefully many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we're talking about 300 of a <unk> that we interpret 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the game field of game without being <unk> and that anybody who are <unk> to the first base, not to come to time, and the second base is <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody who in 10 strokes, get to get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Women's Women's League of <unk> on making more 400 hits on a regular season.
Now let's take this into my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a distant place and a wanted to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But do you know what?
She's getting better at a profound time.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask them.
What do you think about it must be the average of a heart surgeon or a <unk> nurse, or a <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a <unk>
What we do, though, is to send them to the world, and I would included, with the mandate to be perfect.
You'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that he <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian made up to a blood test.
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the diagnosis of frequent <unk> and not less.
And I even knew the real diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were <unk> it would know everything, or more possible, close to everything, because I get away from the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when brought to the lady <unk> to the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I emergency emergency room to go to a cardiologist I got to attend that patient.
And reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I read it, I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which sent me a <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of exposed the blood to go forward, this is all filled with blood, and so there's a difficulty going to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was given.
He gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I was very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring it up to it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who will give constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
By the sent home, he didn't take attention to a voice on my inner voice that was like, <unk> is not a good idea. We don't know.
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse to go to the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'll be OK."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed up and the ambulance along with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal with the stomach, that evening,
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I went off to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot, where my car was to go home. And I did something I don't do normally, at that time.
I went through the emergency service on the way home.
And there another nurse, not the one that I was talking about Mrs. <unk> before, but another one told me three words -- those three words that most emergency doctors would come in.
Other specialists fear it as well, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients.
The three words are <unk> <unk>
Does the patient remember that he sent to her <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
By an hour of having come to his house, after I was given the tall, suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> they brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock high.
I just kept breathing and blue.
The emergency personnel with all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because he was <unk> was in intensive care, and I expected it to all hope that they were <unk>
And in the age of two or three days it was clear that he never <unk>
He had permanent damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to become what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few weeks -- I was reminded of it, and I felt for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt like <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch it with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The shame I'm talking about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt feel.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would put things out and I made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting up those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And in my worst <unk> I mean, why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did <unk>
Little at little that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in one day he <unk> the sky, and he finally went out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me with me in which if I was going to take the efforts to be perfect for not to make any more mistakes, I would stop those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it became coming.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little <unk>
He <unk> him penicillin and sent him home.
But while he was headed to the door following her <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my shift in guard, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
He came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it can be the close of those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
You would get <unk> antibiotics by going down, and it's recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back and went back to work, until again and over and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation in them.
They put an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out normal. A colleague of mine was checking the patient to a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and called the surgeon to the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
And I checked it and notice some sensitivity in the bottom right, called the surgeon in the surgeon.
They both were operated and recovered very well.
But each case, I was <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst errors in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you're going to hear about the errors of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about your own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- so I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> who are making mistakes and the ones that no, those who can't sleep and the ones that I know; that they have <unk> results and ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you get away from medicine to people who make mistakes, keep us a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I have made a personal study of high medical health and errors in the first article that I wrote for Toronto Star <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, contemporary art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where errors happen every single day, in which one in 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where quantum infections are increasingly increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die of 24,000 Canadian mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on my chest, and it comes to <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we move ourselves, and we remove all the professional professionals -- well, not to stay anybody.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white, Art art, it's a custom of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the chief of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah, <unk> blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone at them.
And their students were <unk> to go down and go down the head and see them and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They will be able to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The Nigerian doctor is human, you know, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to try to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the errors of other people not with intention to <unk> but a loving way, and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, we are <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently did a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice he says to pick a half a half a half a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks of these executives and the time that we engage in making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of his time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do they grade how to deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choice to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University at Stanford, <unk> this <unk> supermarket was very, very <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water -- and this was when we were taking water from it.
I loved going to that store, but I was wondering why I never buy nothing?
This is the <unk> oil shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> that were coming from trees <unk>
Once I decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of classes.
I would put a post for <unk> right to the store.
We put out there with six <unk> or 24 flavors of it, and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> one 60 that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when I was <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
Of the one that he stood when he had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six than if they were in 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably miss -- less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of options is affecting us in a very good way to keep <unk>
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we observed the decisions about savings for retirement retirement for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of costs companies available in savings plans to prevent the program to save people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding -- there was less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that put them on a <unk> the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choice, even in that case there is negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will be <unk> to prevent actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there were more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would have to optimize to optimize financial financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decision, that <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, in the health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it going better.
The main reason is that we will have to look at that variety of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for how we can compare it, and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we've come from, in one way or another, in different research, so that you can try and test in your business.
The first one is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, than less is more.
People always care about when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But in fact what we're seeing is that if you choose to cut, you get rid of strange <unk> getting a <unk> increase in sales, <unk> cost, there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that was less likely to become <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and under costs.
You know that the score on average today, you have 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there's a few 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to handle the best choices is <unk> David <unk> the Harvard <unk> program.
All the employees of Harvard are <unk> automatically to a safe fund of life.
Who really wanted to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those choices.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before we started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me he would be willing to offer you to the people in this audience about a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want they to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay, whatever is ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually had to hear more hands.
All right.
And actually, you had more information in the first round, that in the two, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the <unk> of choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences should be to feel very much very concrete in a very concrete way.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit or debit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it be a very positive tool that it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being sold to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting, which is that they <unk> exactly how we <unk> we had a little <unk>
So what we added was that I would give the staff to think of the positive things that would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
So for example, this is a study that we did in a magazine aisle in a row.
We saw that in the retail <unk> I was seen in the <unk> <unk> exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out that's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This classification is completely useless.
The categories must tell something to you who are not going to get them to the <unk>
And you often see this problem with these huge lists of funds.
Now I was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if we just put it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a real <unk> decision buying a car.
This is a car German manufacturer that allows you to completely <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, to get back your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each other.
I have the outer color of the car. I've got 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four choices.
What I'm going to do is change the order of the order of the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few little boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the flaw over and over again, and more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to a lot, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was we disrupt the order of the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we chose to choose the box of changes don't tell anything about the preferences of inner <unk> in all ways that they make us choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
Just to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> eliminating <unk> alternatives -- to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've been presented to you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
So I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to be <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s in the East <unk> in the East <unk> if you had a typewriter you had to go to the government.
I had to record a leaf text from written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of your texts.
If they were writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this will make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser color printer from any large manufacturer and you print a page, that page will end up having a little printed yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, large amounts.
There are actually a lot of <unk> in line, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson Anderson <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their <unk> online but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy it in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The secret of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us is the victim of a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going on the worse.
In the future, most of the crimes are online online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests are motivating them, motivating them to find them.
groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the online attacks.
These are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national and the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of the government against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> from the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
Do you start the safety of the site and make a <unk>
I was asked last week, I said, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if he <unk> <unk> death of people because of attack <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die from an attack on these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do we do the <unk>
Well, you need to do if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority authority.
And that was a <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the headquarters for the secret secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
And there was this folder called <unk>
And inside that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government, tools to intercept a large scale the communications in the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
So, Western governments provide tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago was found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case -- it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But now it's going over there.
It gets <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument makes no sense.
It's game privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we would have today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows and the Yellowstone National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to make it, and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
People were dying are warriors who protect our community and the cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think there are so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A kid in my community, in six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock livestock and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions would give them fear.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because I even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
I don't know <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick male lions and they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are really smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving, and it's always here.  So he went and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions came out.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one that will turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
They <unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery gives the electricity to the small <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give the outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never went back to having trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that male lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to frightening to other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using it for elephants elephants in the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up the lights in the houses that they don't have, and I show them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes and tell me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions work.
What's the next thing on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a fence fence CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you were invented fences with electric fences -- but I want to make my mine.
CA: You know, one time, right? And <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I stood because I got a <unk>  CA: The foot of the cannon. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to take it in every step that I have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little bit, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Although I was asking myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all of my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague of my sister.
And that said, "When I do this, the five member of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead on the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at her head by looking at her mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine called North Korea to <unk>
In the end, more than one million North Koreans died during famine and only they survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark in the night except by the sea lights in China, just across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light, and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared with the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I got out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine -- I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a refugee <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
And a day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I went into the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a official told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were it eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was fortunate to escape, many other Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided that I risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even I went through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or a <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea it was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the university exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The Minister of North Korea would save some money that sent my family, and, as a punishment my family was going to be moved to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea, and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and approached by a Chinese police officer.
He asked them all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately he believed me.
We made the whole way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribing the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in capital capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to cut away from the <unk> embassy of South Korea.
I went and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asking, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family, and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I went back to my heart, and I asked her, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the people who are <unk> when I was <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices in English language, practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in touch with relatives still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern Center.
This is <unk> <unk> shops of fast, fast food, <unk>
So the city planners come together, and they thought, we're going to change the South Center name to represent something else, so they changed in the South L.A., as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong with the city.
This is South L.A.,  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, the home of food sites to carry and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to carry kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying from infectious diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
And I was reminded of seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of your house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see <unk> chairs and sold as <unk> cars.
I see centers of <unk> <unk> like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and is the solution.
And I also got tired I've got to drive 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, at Green <unk> we get together and we started to plant our forest of food, trees -- <unk> you know, nine complete vegetables here.
What we do, we are a kind of a paid group of paid <unk> made by gardeners of all the <unk> all over the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city went on top and <unk> and I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> was made by <unk>
And I said, "Come on it, right?
A national order of planting food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I would even call to say that it <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> land.
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That is enough to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on the hell does it look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they cultivate your own food.
You get your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I was afraid to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Such a <unk> artist <unk> walls -- I <unk> floors, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It will be <unk> to see what the Earth can do.
You just can't imagine how astonishing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how it affects the guys.
And gardening is the <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this is only <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people leave to steal your <unk>
And I say, "Oh my God no, I don't fear you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I gave me their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed -- so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in a volunteer.
If kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they are debating and I see kids in this path that are designed for them, which is not carrying them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who were <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers to turn them into healthy.
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free, it's not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to try to work with people, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So the <unk> take your <unk> right?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> --  <unk> of the <unk>  Probably everybody agrees with me that this is a very good road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go out on your bicycle and these cars go through that is not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution to do that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use right now in most of the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, so all the water rainwater flow into the sides and they will have a road that it's easy to drive, and not to waste water anymore.
The noise also disappear.
Because it's very open -- all of the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
So what is <unk> Look at this road in the surface of the surface <unk>
First, a stone, then many more and more and more and more, etc., you won't do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of <unk> to light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> -- this <unk> the glue between the <unk> and if you <unk> you will be <unk> and you separate from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
So to solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material that we can get together, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the wool of steel in smaller chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of knitting wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will flow back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine from <unk> here onstage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat up samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the freeway <unk> where we had to do a lane of testing this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and we know them, then with our <unk> machine and the '50s, and we went back to them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using fibers, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, they can even double the life of the surface of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how I look at it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> in his little gray radio.
I had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school <unk> he said.
One morning I forget.
A real school?
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban <unk> Afghanistan and made it illegal that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to meet my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route to make sure that no one could suspect where you are.
We had to hide the books on market bags so it looks like flying shopping.
School was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. It <unk> where his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my mother raised a teacher.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to educate her children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated with our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it.
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school from <unk> College in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home to the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not only about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador to educate the women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my mine, <unk> for them, even though even in front of a dramatic opposition.
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the road from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped to being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if I kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if he <unk> he said, "but not to hurt the future of my daughter for their old and <unk> ideas."
What I have given to me about Afghanistan, and it's something that is very often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is just as different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And I think these changes wouldn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who went through them, and I see them, I see the future <unk> and a durable <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of the <unk> I was arrested.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as well as <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> they were in the slums, the fall of the regime, the <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a mess with the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from <unk> East, to the west, all the way to the south.
Finally, after a period of six brutal war and a few losses of about 50,000 dead were able to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved a lot of other women, rebuild civil society civil society, <unk> <unk> <unk> to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women, we founded <unk> of Women founded by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> leaders, to advocate for women's autonomy autonomy and for our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
And I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Eventually, our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won an <unk> of Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news news news.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> graves and <unk>
Another day -- with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military.
And every day, each day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their nonstop human rights violations.
Our society, made up of the political mentality became more <unk> more, and it's away from ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the cones of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all at <unk> with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm right here today to say that we, as a nation, choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't bring the peace, stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as well as women for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the elections, which just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the representation of the female representation of the feminine <unk> and quantitative of it.
We need to stop acting like disgust agents and calling for anger.
We need to start acting as compassion agents and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, that not just <unk> but also put it into practice <unk> instead of <unk> in place of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, led to war, needs desperately to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that spans the whole humanity of which men and women, which all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so the same as the uterus has completely covered the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion by turning the whole existence.
This is what it comes to us, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
This is what he is like, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a beautiful question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the ones that everybody gets a long <unk> Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, and I am not a social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He was <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret to it.
My secret was that many, many times, the man that I believed my soul <unk> I was attached to my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm an English English English School in Harvard University, and I have a MBA in Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years married with my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the <unk> all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> and <unk> relationships or <unk> or said in the families, the last place we would want or would expect or find <unk> reason which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told them that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who sticks, and in fact I was a very typical victim of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or its patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> university and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the most impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had big <unk> like apples, and a hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything in front of me, who was ready to Harvard who was passionate about helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had ever done it.
And it was so that the bachelor's of <unk> and the work in Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was coming into head in a physical trap and financial trap carefully ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that website is supposed to be so safe to feel so safe to get three <unk>
One had the <unk> in the car.
The other one kept it under the pillow in our bed, and the third time in his pocket.
And he said that I needed these guns to cause the trauma to a small kid.
I needed to feel safe.
But these guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had occurred, he was sure that we lived happy forever, because I loved it, and he loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was simply a whole sense of <unk> for the wedding and a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and I would never hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so strong in the head that I was <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back on our moon of honey and broke out of the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Control Control Center, that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man -- and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face their <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is, why is it simply not <unk>
Why didn't you <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and painful question that people are doing -- because we are victims, we know something that normally you <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges at spending time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we still ask why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke silence.
I told the whole world to the police, to my neighbors, my friends, all my friends and my friends and I am here today because all of you have <unk>
We have the tendency to translate the victims to the victims of the <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say, <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that <unk> their lives of joyful lives and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I became marrying a cute guy, cute man and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and I have this <unk>
What I'm not going to get back to you may not be a loaded gun pointing to my head in someone who says I want.
Right now, they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what silly thing <unk> but this whole time I have been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end up in end to my mad love, breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrive only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They took the abuse to the light talking about it with their kids, their colleagues at work, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe side.
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a kind of uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed in like this.  Luckily, I brought them clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you guys have a lot of luck to you, I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself in so only 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that chance.
These are very <unk> less than I don't have to use it.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh from me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer I was telling me that I was going on my back and <unk> the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan -- like the one I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our appearance, which is which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I am a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you become a role model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which we are biologically hardwired to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my future <unk> that I've known to use to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing as much as models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from University of New York City to say all and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- it's less than four percent, not white weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know that.
But then what I would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be the president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or one surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this list was still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> magazine or the executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be a model is to say you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you have to come up with your studies, and you have a script and a few jobs on your back, no matter what <unk> is to say -- if you want to be president of the United States, but you do you choose you to be the <unk> of underwear for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, you know, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was amazed and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're going into the personal field, but I was a little girl.
So I looked up next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a couple of days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people in <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, let's make it for free?
I have too many heels. I have too much heels. And that will never use, except for the previous couple of it, but the privilege I get to get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress to me.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and he was jumped on red <unk> and, of course, we got a red <unk> and I was sorry, and so I can keep a <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- I don't think I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what it looks like no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were married and 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It was how many times he <unk> me and <unk>
By looking at this talk, I learned that to 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you would do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras -- what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask them, with some smaller legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to come together with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs and the brightest hair, but probably the most insecure physically women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain from this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in perception we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was most important enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures I was <unk> and I didn't go the <unk>
There were no directors of <unk> or no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little care of the lighting in light.
In fact, most of them gave them tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give me a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and <unk>
He happened that we went back to New York City a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started asking for tourists who were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a three-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular time or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a week in October and actually think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always put the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches the new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something we hope with illusion all the year.
And recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, we were walking, when he suddenly stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the gift store, which <unk> little <unk>
And he described to me what it was in the age of five years in that same place.
<unk> that reminded his heart <unk> with force when I first nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes out of the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't want to get closer to somebody and ask him, and get us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are located in the most <unk> group.
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.
<unk> are <unk>   And you're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the Old World Bank where we have 16 species -- of these 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they going to be important -- first of all, provide vital ecological services <unk>
These are our natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the <unk> up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax that not being for them would stretch and cause huge losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and under Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil?
In <unk> culture are made very important <unk> in places like Tibet, to open up in places like Tibet, and there is no place to bury the dead or wood, so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are extremely <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the <unk> critically list, which means that in less than 10 to 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey with livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs have a huge amount of time to <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the aquatic birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrific trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Okay, we're investigating these birds.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a housing problem, it's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> <unk> <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you get out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed from opinion because he saw it fly without effort, without any energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.   I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Coast of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
And we would go to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with seed <unk> to the south of Zambia into this absolutely amazing valley that goes down into the <unk> River, and we teach the local tomatoes to grow Italians and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would give them to come to work, and sometimes they would not be <unk>  We were amazed that the grassroots in that fertile fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not <unk> nothing, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  It would take time to save the people from Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a virtual ball would grow this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red from the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only of us the Italians know, errors in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what they did, what they were doing, what they were doing, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>   <unk> to see the waste that we would tell the <unk> people from Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read his book.
Some of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root root that means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to get any culture in different than if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I try to do all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the side of the face, "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said for about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman opened this conference on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at 27 years to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never initiate anything, you ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion -- the <unk> of the local people who have a dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? It <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We got together in a cafe and we sat down at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person is going to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
And so years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for a time, they would give them to them, but not in meetings in their communities.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with meetings in their communities.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity has they <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know that because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work on face face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The career is the family physician of the company, the family doctor of the business who sets up with you in your house at the table of your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I was <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away into '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
Now, planning is the kiss of death of the business spirit.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> reconstructing not knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you to <unk> privacy, it has to be great to <unk> and then they will come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
So what are you going to talk about is this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossils are not renewable -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a good story that in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> he gathered together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not there in 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure was produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic manufacturing companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in places that are <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they wouldn't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And later you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, the largest company, has to be able to do three things: <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell with a terrific financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
And we've looked at the 100 <unk> companies in the world, <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new companies -- Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one was just started by one person.
I never know the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in bars in bars with their dedicated business environment, who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what need to take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us who are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't spend a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors are for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
So how do we share our hopes for cows store so that our communities can reflect our needs and make our own <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always supporting the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned <unk>
I live near this house, and I thought that I could turn it into a very nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
his death was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this occurred to me a profound gratitude for time lived and time.
It gave clarity to the meaningful things of my life today.
But let's go back to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it is easy to be catching by the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this giant house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what this experiment was, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before he died, I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
"Before he died, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before he died, I want to give you one more."
"Before he died, I want to go to the <unk>
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about to know that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways to new ways -- it's about to give up the reflection and the <unk> and remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the middle of the civic center we made a kit, and now they've been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than individuals and as community and with more means individuals and as community and more means to share hope, and people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
It doesn't speak, but it makes joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice this is never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even remember -- it reminds me how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
It was <unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that I went out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we pioneered when I was four years old, you would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit to fit the concept of <unk> of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though it was the case, if you didn't consider it inside it, that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual there is a different way, from there that <unk> be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing development disorders that are increasing in the world, there is no cause of <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play a game like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I lived and <unk> in its own world, with its own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that would have <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and frustration and <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child to see the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just just like me.
But I look back to the things that I've taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normality.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift on their interior and, honestly, the pursuit of normality, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time that we try to be like each other.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor of communications, giving me a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  Real <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and his big books and unknown words.
But as those conversations, I felt what <unk> should have felt when he fell through the <unk> <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care and each other, and if we don't know how we don't understand this, the job is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you just study the <unk> but you study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat it.
And when you're describing your science, care of <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them silly <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein, are all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate his science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories, stories and analogies -- and they are ways to hook and engage with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do we do the <unk> die and get them into their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's just due to the area of the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
And the trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we will provide graphs that we bring up to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are just the key ones that can help the others open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of the Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century who defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge -- which is <unk> or it or start, and when he wins, he gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that they were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the first name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put him on the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's literal one.
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
Don't you know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They had all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the U.S.
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tried to be <unk>
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed supply.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired -- <unk> because this debate is <unk> for three weeks.
I read the diary of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of <unk> I didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it to him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give him the most <unk> more insignificant degree, and the more <unk> it came up with.
And that title was <unk>
And President. Not invented the title. There was no longer before, but it just meant <unk> that he <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a degree.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a <unk> and <unk> degree of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama was lucky enough to keep out there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep us out for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this is the most important thing, and with this is that the President of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has laced the title of <unk>
So in the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations are now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they are now President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give it to you.
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually, the reality changes much more the words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is charged with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but mostly that <unk> <unk> and rocks <unk> with mathematical tools.
Like the other people, I take a cheap propane propane cardboard, and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep inside that hole in risking their lives without paying no reward and often dying.
I went home from that hole and I went home but they may never do, because they're prey for slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the city of Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who's dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as a degree.
When we finished talking to me -- I was very sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how much people don't know?
I was made up the stomach and a few weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
And so my journey started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them, even I thought it was my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are currently over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during the entire <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary from a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
And yet, today we can enslave entire families for generations per debt <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education promises and better work to find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slave have <unk> but those who are producing them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal to be illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like going to the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 C, men, women, -- in fact, entire families -- in fact, entire families -- in a weighed outside of mechanically ventilated package brick in their head, to 18 to 18 at the time, and they take them out of <unk> blast to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> they work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no support to eat, and not to drink, and the severe <unk> I was making just a lot of <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the powder that my camera was <unk> <unk> and let it work.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
And back in the furnaces I wanted to cry, but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it."
And he explained very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were already already.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his release, and he trusted that <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, he found kids <unk> stones for miles per <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
These big <unk> were more heavy than children who would charge and the children <unk> their heads up to their heads with straps and <unk> <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
There's nothing to <unk>
When these villagers sang their freedom, the <unk> they dropped their houses.
When we hear the word slavery we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global awareness that would be hard to me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was told by women who had been previously trained <unk>
And I was driving me on a few <unk> <unk> that would give this <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for prostitution in posed practice.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- are forced to customers <unk> and to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
From the <unk> I remember a fear of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be caught up in the hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows for <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a hard subject, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves every year.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often interact with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families on the silk trade.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father, and the blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and they dive into the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we come, I went through a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a boat, two older brothers, some more young children -- some more young children -- makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all <unk>
Children are separated from their extended families <unk> and they were forced to work a lot of time in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The <unk> branches of tree submerged in Lake <unk> will often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, it's thrown into water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the youngest slaves under her charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from a day.
<unk> in the cold and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where I was <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
Kofi is what was possible.
Who's going to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partnerships with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> who would suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to put it on a road from land to the forest.
At the end of the road, we would stop getting out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then pointed out this path just the visible path and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started down, we take away the <unk> that I walked on the road, and after walking around an hour we found out that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as I went through these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up on their backs, and while they were looking for gold <unk> they were looking for <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, given a lot of them had been under land during 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet, and these people have carry heavy heavy bags, which then will be shipped back to another area where the stone would be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look close to the margin we see to work at some less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of violence and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends as this victim of T.B. and the <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
He died his uncle, <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the uncle that force it to be slave for mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the '50s and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it must be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet, is forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of your face to a remote possibility, which makes me much respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted to know that we will have testimony to them and we'll make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can look at each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There is no day to happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images come up with a force in the people you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out to be on a fire and that fire, light up about slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do this mathematical math and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like managing transit.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
And dance is one of the more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet
In the last few years, it has been successful progress in treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to need tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement is no biological markers and that's why the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip into the clinic. What if patients could get the exam <unk>
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to talk to you as a really conventional form for a try, you see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy while they make sounds like this, and we can imagine as a dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- for example.
And like the ballet of it, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of vocal cords as it <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both accurate. Well, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
Very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a huge cost of scale, it appears to massive scale.
These are some incredible lists to address.
We can reduce the patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for follow-up <unk>
With high <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do a massive low cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it is too late.
So by giving up the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative, <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or Parkinson's or Parkinson's disease, can call low price and <unk> and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease -- TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> They may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion for the disease of the disease.
TR: They have an precision <unk> at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have done a fantastic job, and now it has been shown that it works in the mobile phone network as well, what we did the project, we now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March before 2011, I was <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the dark, under the windows without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin -- we still do the impossible, and we were in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience, and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that were happening in Japan.
Soon after time later, an organization where the <unk> was <unk> -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small village of fishermen located in <unk> <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first towns affected by wave.
The level of water is recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the ground.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
We took off schools. We took the slime off, and we left the lists for being <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish died, <unk> <unk>
We loved it, and we loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
We would take them up and take them to different places of the villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While he was fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the massive bathrooms and gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I had the honor of that day and I had the honor of that day to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard more of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I grew up my horizons.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that they had more than a hundred years ago there were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had fallen into the face of the girl I was having to get it very accurately and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't look like it, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
Over the time, they came by lucky enough -- and they got more <unk> so he went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
In two weeks, I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village north to the north of <unk>
Once a week we used our scanner in the educational libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story -- depends on the <unk> of the photos.
I could fit an hour. I could make it a few weeks.
I could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using a guide the areas whose color and detail the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these photos of the water <unk> covered with bacteria, with algae -- even oil -- and all of them together with the time time I continue to <unk> so that <unk> was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was <unk> dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos we already have.
As he said once -- the leader of my group is how to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she was stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to put the images in a single photo and make it the whole picture.
When I picked up his pictures shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find his whole family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her photos her photos his youngest <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up more of <unk> photos -- the great <unk> -- most of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 hundred and hundreds of wild photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than a thousand dollars in teams and materials, most of them on ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of somebody or something, one thing, somebody loved it.
These are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take on, but the first thing we would take to look for.
So about this was the project, and to restore small pieces of humanity, from giving somebody their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger, giving back something, using their talent to something that are not really thin skin models.
And so I would like to read this email and sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering about a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter was just <unk> takes off our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this photo of a bullet that cuts through an exhibition on one millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video slow into motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X, Y and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it up and put it into a <unk> of the second or so, in various <unk> to create a photo package of photons just one millimeter of <unk>
And that packet of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a regular bullet does.
If we take that bullet on this bullet and this kind of photons and photons pack in this bottle, how do you spread out those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --   -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to take this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
And then the pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a bunch of photons and starts <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally gets to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights in the top part of the bottle, and then from several boxes, the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and current bullet and we make it run the same distance and you see it slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think you would take you to see that movie?
One day?
It would be a very boring movie -- a bullet in motion.
And what about testing with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato and the background wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> they follow brilliant -- not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it turns out after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT? India?
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo at low exposure, it comes very little into it.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest show, so I'll just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package <unk> million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and sort of interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, though.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works for fast, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what about a distance.
By projecting a laser, you can record a lots, which you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction one.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> with what's around the curve, there.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that you can see the interior of the body as well as <unk> and the same for <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualizing the problems of thinking about the health of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, turned science into art, an art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can imagine.
We create a new form of computational photography with slow camera, and code <unk>
And look at those waves and look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a <unk> of a second.
But here is a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events are happening in the world sometimes comes to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can hold up life, and you give you freedom freedom.
With a mobile phone can be <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone can be tweet and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record your song, you can put it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people were gathering that <unk> for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who are your phone <unk>
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone up.
<unk> An elephant, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how my life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission on E.U. filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, every single <unk> Internet provider has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who's sent to <unk>
And if we use your phone, where we are.
This whole information is stored for at least six months, and even two years, in their phone company or your Internet provider or your <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data database.
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers, and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, and priests, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who in the time was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information that I had about me.
I asked them one time, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, you saw a deal.
I took the demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown on a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 thousand lines of information.
And I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can get closer and zooming in, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate each other and what time they call each other, what time they would be to sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who send your email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known to know who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall of Berlin probably had never happened.
And as a result, even the fall of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have a chance to follow our lives and they want to take it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When I go home to their friends back to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just as fashion.
When you go home, let's go back to your representative one, because the companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.

You feel bad about me, because at some point in life, they've been a disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas Christmas, are in the shopping mall, drive in search of parking and what they see?

I always loved my neighborhood and my illness have the same principles.
I also love that if I want to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't think puede" percent.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk>
If my three biggest sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they were terrified that I was out of me, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note all the way out of my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that it was <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion which has received many <unk>
By growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and remain all of the family,  I think no one realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> like <unk>
People who I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that they would die of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so I stopped dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I was sent to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to go on the summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were interested in <unk>
On the summer holidays my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink milk and warm me up on the back, they would go back to warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before he did yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with the <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on my head.
My parents had a sense that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through a positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, lifted up the top note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo of glass -- my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> when I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end, we finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater department, crying in historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask me why and she told me that because they believed that I could do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't make the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role that literally had been born and gave it to an actor.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
I went home, and my first tour tour, it was extra as extra in a <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I wouldn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> directors are not <unk> actors were not white, white, with disabilities.
Just give you perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
That's why I became <unk>
In my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first note that he took when he landed on the realization that he was at high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, not censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little nasty rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York City Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and when you remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited by invited to the news program by cable has a Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduation dance -- I went back to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the desk that I didn't get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not go back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was left like <unk> <unk> and he pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
And the kids are said that children are <unk> but they never become a little bit of me and no older than I was anymore.
Suddenly, my disability in the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terror <unk>
What a disease does it?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make anybody on wheels.
The disability are the -- Yeah, <unk> <unk>
The disability are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
And the doctors were saying they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
Yet having grown up with the media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that would be less than a <unk>
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still use the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children refugees in Palestinian refugees a little bit of what my parents were <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young people in a young town.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small village in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
The drought drives to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there are no work, no <unk>
He has just been living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After a year maybe <unk> nothing.
One day he gets about a gentleman who offers him to take him back to dinner, after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
She gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
He presented to a young lady.
He finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
One beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy from that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he got out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who seek something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they are not allowed to give them any opportunities, the history of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the story of 2.0.
And in my city, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not work at school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some juvenile leaders at a corporate kitchen.
It was going to be about 90 leaders juvenile <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to large challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a college graduate student, I was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> arrested at local residents who normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What makes this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate <unk> and I think the spirit of business can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
It teaches young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so for.
And you can train the young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years ago, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from coming from abroad.
If you give somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those of you who grew up during civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> design company.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive hard <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers to wedding by creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working in creating the first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the young families, the young men can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink roses <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We inspected business solutions for local problems.
So we inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and orientation for <unk> in development and put in their businesses.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from understanding to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the spirit of business is more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Yellowstone Park. This is how it is called, when it's created, turning the way that people see their city.
He hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I had about ten years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we were looking at -- almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts, <unk> balls of aluminum <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and so <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed me, and he got a little bit.
Who will clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York City, the <unk> Department -- the clean Department of <unk> and <unk> metric tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I do that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled into the trucks and truck and I interviewed people in offices and I interviewed people in the city and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go to more.
So I started to work as <unk> of crap.
Now I don't just travel in the trucks. I <unk>
And he operated with mechanical <unk> and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
This is not as rich as we believe, and in the days when it's very strong you will go very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies followed by <unk> the weight of bringing on their body tons of garbage every weeks.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor <unk> the collection of waste is one of the <unk> most dangerous stars in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and coming into the traffic all day and go <unk> around you.
They just want to be <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of town, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient form of efficient and effective form of the day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent to us in very real forms.
Because we had controlled for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the motors from the economy begin to fail when the consumption is in danger.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out their relationship.
And then it's what I call our everyday average speed necessary.
And so I mean just how fast we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually have no <unk> and cleaned up with us and we carry our coffee cup of coffee, our water <unk>
We use it, we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that we would take out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about harvesting waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and adapt to that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us left us except for ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went upstairs and there was a man making his journey of <unk> as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
Let's be OK."
Shortly after that, I started researching the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to embrace and have to account all costs, including the very real human cost of labor labor.
The Brazilian waste -- what we think is when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see somebody whose work is to clean up the garbage -- they will give you a moment to get it.
So let's give you a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to thinking about our local life connection, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both of these projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis plain.
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of the city in town, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the coating with <unk> generates heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it is a climate that goes out of 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And third, its aspect is nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was really enchanted by the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how we build a modern building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to survey the site, which is located in a much growth zone of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs in the building.
And this goes down with a <unk> atrium, that creates a space to the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in each floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete beetle's <unk> to allow the air entrance, and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas was not very easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what I <unk>
But we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because the end of the commercial center had been more local.
And then the idea of the facade was much cheaper -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get some savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think of how it was able to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity was cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which in a set of water is collected in the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing I ever had, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I had special <unk> <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a <unk> wall of access connected by nearly straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets in existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks in size and features to those in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points for the idea of the doors of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell of the project, like the <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore an natural ventilation.
So we would have a scheme -- that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks of <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local standards that they set up a greater density at higher levels and lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving up the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and <unk> and make activities, like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look for the architecture looking for simple solutions, but we need to make sure that they enhance the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had very bright amounts of hair, and a little <unk> of pencils and a little <unk> of pencils I was very strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after I was out of school, I was a little afternoon and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took from the table of my teacher grades.
And then I did.
I put the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some Like this.
So all the Like --  And I set up to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row of them -- just by being there, because I <unk>
It still strikes me what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good for me.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was telling me the reason why I thought that this little girl was so small, it was so good at <unk>
It <unk> me, jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates.
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if it wouldn't have jealousy, <unk> would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> no thousand and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No jealousy, <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, most of them have all of them.
This year is now 100 years of his masterpiece, "In looking for the <unk> time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of the sexual <unk> and my mind -- everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think of a child trying to get to sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the wave of cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they are going so well together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as that jealousy, that causes it to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a well-known narrative base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what the <unk> details to nail the knife, right?
The <unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understand.
Everything that she does to make me pleasure could give you pleasure maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good language -- with the comparison of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy, <unk> listening to the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then yes, those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're really scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make us look like <unk> but in their <unk> they're finding <unk> but in their <unk> it's really painful in fact, a really painful truth, in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the better the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways for <unk> wisdom.
He says, "A woman to who we need to do, that makes us experience, causes us to have a range of feelings that are much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some of the other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife <unk> him.
And Freud said there was something weird in that man who didn't get confused in what his wife did.
Well she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, and he doesn't realize it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or did they accidentally marry a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels, they describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become the most fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal acts of acts of it.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I am thinking about myself in the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman from Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which they were sending horrible horrible to themselves, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former former 30s, and I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big as we make creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, <unk> that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take on your own and <unk> from what you've ever <unk> and it's under the floor, beating your name, leads your rings, your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route for Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in a time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not secure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse of Professor <unk> that criminal.
But I've always happened to be <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of those mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you go, <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> comes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> rushed in history. It seems to me very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to be <unk> that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a topic of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the greatness in the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like to make plans for <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, we remember we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction -- jealousy.
<unk> used to be <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent <unk>
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin came out of the Apollo Street <unk> and he landed on the <unk> Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest time in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA would spend about 180 billion dollars from today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave the work to about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 <unk> universities and universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program was <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which he came backstage with Armstrong <unk> last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and <unk> of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words in the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Tell me some ask, why is it <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why is it going to scale up the <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly about the <unk>
Why do you play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> was not just a victory of the West about the east in the Cold War.
In the time, the strongest emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
It was because it was something great to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and just eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle, but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
Since the 1970s, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagined that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the global population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube of the rocket.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I would come to see colonies on Mars.
So it actually came up with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have met, and they had enriched with trivial toys -- things like <unk> apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale of <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an evolutionary explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that <unk> from the years in which we <unk> Intel and Microsoft, and <unk> and <unk>
Silicon Valley said that markets are the guilty, specifically, the incentives that the venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to offer people.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment made to be <unk> the creation of ideas led by <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at its peak without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, investment investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development technology, which need a huge capital and developing capital for the long term, don't have invested in the development of dedicated technologies because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we do not solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than making on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil and oil and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what political <unk> and national treaties -- the development of increasing energy -- a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy energy policy or treaties the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they will not be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the food process.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and exchange of food, but there will be famines as governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon would read the war war in 1971, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some tasks, <unk> to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need to, but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the political leaders have to support the <unk> it must actually be a problem of <unk> and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it does with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no political competition, like the Cold War, there is no politician like John <unk> that <unk> the difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like the way we explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to begin with <unk> the ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives you a clearest idea about it.
First of all, the <unk> why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I turn to think that there may be gone down in some activities or institutions and institutions that might have increased in others.
I don't know that.
But I can focus on opinion polls and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep taking the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost just half a way.
But this is what enough?
What record opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people manifests himself when certain questions are being done when they do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> teachers.
I probably wanted to ask: "To do what?"
And that would be a very strong answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them but in the other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel about a certain type of official <unk> or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all of those.
I could, for example, say that I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give you the class class, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust -- because they try to <unk> the good inherent trial in fact to trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
This is not the goal that I <unk>
I would have more trust in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
And ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who put their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart target in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> that is the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's all about is to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw subjects and is responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, you're not responsible to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I <unk> your own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to do very much before trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to do?
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that they made us easier the task to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> that I will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we found the system of accountability which is destined to ensure <unk> and evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must probably all know similar examples.
Let's get all of that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you were to stop being worthy of trust, and we will give people to people that are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
It takes the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But trust itself is a signature because they give us other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations of enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to give it a lot of <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> and institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- says I can <unk> it without giving explanations out.
I wear it back and return the money, or they change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson at that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have come up with us to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone again and more and more and more and more, which today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how it <unk>
So first I created this tool that gets back into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen the transfers your physical body to the pixels.
Designers can take their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the division of Sciences Sciences with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, you get inside the space of space and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, it is as easy as we grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and bring out lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and turned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, this only physical frontier.
This magnet <unk> is like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
So what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the restrictions of time and space and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and distance and forth and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can play play as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience, that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show us something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without having to <unk> ourselves from our world.
So we started today talking about a barrier, but if I put that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to school to play with all expenses spending.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After we survive the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only an accurate path to <unk> a safe work and <unk> job.
Whatever I would like to or not.
But my dream was to be an African opera singer Chinese.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a happiness.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> My <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I arrived in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were voting in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> it's about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> guilt trap.
I find it with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit habit too.
It <unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map was that it seemed to me because this is what students in China learn.
I never thought that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to fields of research like comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if comparative reading worked worked for research, why don't we do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books to two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> duty.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path to <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of getting lost in translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to get to feel like a <unk> ever.
Having a broken dream really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And that's thanks to books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a encountered <unk> threw on my office and took off my office and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My computer colleague had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy to move the head while they were doing the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and so I watched her, she was right.
You start to work later, you go home later, he has kids later, until the death goes on.
In the way that Alex and I had time to have a while.
But shortly after, my squad <unk> <unk> to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys underneath his category, he was <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like I was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe he <unk> on the next.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time, and we were looking at it.
And so I realized, that this kind of Port <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think that no one comes to adulthood.
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> give you a <unk> a <unk> I want to see -- okay, <unk> the skills of truth matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give her life to have been in order to have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, they live or come out with their future future 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> to <unk> what it means that if there is something that you want to change themselves, now is the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more sometimes during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to their endgame to 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to take care of their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday life and common life has an impact on the person that was <unk>
But what we don't hear with often is that there's something called adult development, and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
Researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> journalists named <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every day every day, smart <unk> like you or your children and your daughters get to my office and say this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't matter. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better deal with the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes on the <unk> were how the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around the 30, it turned to music and all they started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing that would be stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds just a bit extreme, but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the <unk> and so many of them start a career, pick a job, pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
And so many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start showing you, which is much more difficult and stressful to have all of the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red.
It's about realizing that you can't have the race you want now.
You'll notice that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
On 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said that he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you can't still decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living with a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They would often get in our <unk> but then she was getting up her saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the <unk> words, please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a crash accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I give me <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist it, and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
So Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
And I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade of Emma passed off.
So, for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that was <unk> from that identity of identity and <unk> identity capital.
For capital capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the race of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital of identity produces identity capital.
So now it's time for that work to the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company that they want to try it.
I'm not looking at exploration exploration, I'm looking at exploration that we should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds in terms of who you know, what do you know, how do you think about it, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from the outside of their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak ties.
Yeah, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the form of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs created never been <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is how you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
By the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family, when I have a partner and there is in the form of his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit on my mind than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with anyone who would be <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate <unk> of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a job in there.
That job supply gave her a reason to leave the boyfriend with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special in events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
He <unk> his new career, I love his new family, and I sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of bone deals are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
Similarly, at the same way, the 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea of spreading to all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling the homeless and every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital, get their capital capital, use their ties.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to graduate students, in New York City in New York.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
I gave them assignments.
When I went back, I will have grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had no scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during the time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
So what if you succeed in school and in life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study, my question was, who are successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what we were going to do in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as far as the competition.
We studied teachers who are working in really difficult neighborhoods, <unk> what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the feedback outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking you, which of these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it arose a feature as a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination <unk> and then I waited over a year to see who they were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature I could measure, things as the family income, the results of the tests, even the security results that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National <unk> National <unk> where it matters to purpose.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little you know, the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we development determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job ethic.
How do we keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not going to go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related or related to the verge of talented talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese character.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can take down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, is better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for value.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read enough to read signals from traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> from the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way that it works.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
These are building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old man, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person takes his arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
This is a mother, such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  To remember, as a impossible tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two drops, it gets too hot.
Three feet together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk> <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the <unk> horizon.
So one door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, have care <unk>
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed in the first place, because Japan is at this one.
So a sun is beginning to create Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains around the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you come out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and <unk> and <unk> Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz combined.
The film was burned in their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and get a silver wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of complex fantasy <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took the rise to 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose metal <unk> and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dressed as <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz will do today, the magician would do today, he would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies generated by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I went to watch Star Wars my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  So he was able to be slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom in the outside, behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but he was going to get rid of it.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be issues of value, resilience and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke give a military to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How does his movie?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, OK? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much <unk> capital force in movies for our kids, and so little of the way of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate through the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss we really expected them to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and I'm going to defend the Disney <unk> in front of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though them, the kids are really not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend ourselves from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is continuing to come up with classic <unk> each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who make a little girl.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came back.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what critical is when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies <unk> the Turing test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not roots, and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to begin a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the <unk> of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that are supposed to be <unk> in the movie, there's more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy who <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women exist and talk about things to each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a sense of consensus about what is a Hollywood movie film.
<unk> doesn't happen the Turing test.
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 <unk> movies how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen for Congress, then it's good.
But there is a bigger number that this one is going to take on this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one of five women says it has been sexually <unk> ever in their life.
I don't think it's guilt for mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't they do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then they charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to take it to you.
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You have read about how new economics is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star Trek character <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to get them to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight only and more stories where it looked like their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I loved most was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I would join <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Egypt, had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles of length as a <unk>
And my sea crackers had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrared use.
This is a place located in the eastern delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and activities of ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital of Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place places in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of the old art in architecture and architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> feet.
Before, Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as he changed over time, it moved to this and covered all the city.
So how can you find a city that was going on a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it at random would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So, we use NASA <unk> data to make a place map, with very subtle changes.
We were able to look at where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we thought might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation we look for us.
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer in mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date back from the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> works and <unk> quartz and <unk> what it shows that there was a <unk>
This might seem to be a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, of the Roman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back into this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry, that demonstrates that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't yet find <unk> here, but we would find it in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire is probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do you need ideas really started in 1984 <unk> C. A lost city not for a long time and found it from high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like to pay you attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing for a bike racing race and go direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're jumping a lot.
And they collide against the door of his house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that goes on to their side, the rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- they put the threshold on the front lines.
To the lobby, or what there is on the next side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's <unk>
From his chair, about a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks to it.
You can feel your blue <unk> making you tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you start to get into the mouth.
He went around and stick to their living room.
Already in the room, and making use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his middle <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path and the oven come to you <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of America."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a couple of different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
We got the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
I had full poems for just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize very quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
And I said, <unk> when you noticed you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old memory acts in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the medieval scholars used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, "How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English room, although a little bit <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to show Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of Hollywood <unk> in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> And he was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not such a rare thing as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed also cognitive too.
We have no longer need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find really passionate people about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique memory competition.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: "It will be like some brains or structural or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery.
There was a really interesting difference and really meaningful difference between the brains of the memory lessons and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI scanner, you look at your brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of snow found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they were <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driven as an armed career in which each year, someone has a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors must get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory player.
On the desk in his desk -- there are 36 <unk> of cards, <unk> who's about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there's a lot of ways of remembering things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the way that the psychologists call a single concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> he says this: I say two people who remember the same word -- I say to you, I mean, there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?
The person who said that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different ability to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything to you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance through their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in hands.
They were doing well when they go home to work.
You probably get some <unk>
And when I was <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back to two two years ago in <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as a entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, they didn't get to a <unk> he would go to a <unk>
He stood up foot, his poem from memory, and he was <unk> and so soon he was, the room of the <unk> was <unk>
They will come to everybody.
But not only did it kill everybody, but it shattered the bodies by <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they could not be <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, I closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every day.
I took the family of the <unk> hand, where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What we have to see is the moment that we all know about it is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or the word of the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I tell you that I would give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you tell you to say who was sitting on the <unk> horse in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with your eyes of your mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it out of memory -- the same way that I had done it <unk> if they had invited him to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image and <unk> to help you remember the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and you see the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to present your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk to be that strange journey you did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> not word for word, which is going to confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> it would be like the first place in its dreams of memory.
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got out of full of that.
I went to some of these skills of memory and had the idea of writing a huge thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring <unk> event.
And seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school dealer bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What it's really about to do is to improve more and more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was quite quite a pretty cool thing.
This is me, using my standard standard team of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of the security glasses. covered with just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could be able to get it in sort of a <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be memorize <unk> and phone phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be built to build memory <unk> or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insight, about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply deeply.
The palace of <unk> these techniques of memory are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It would be a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what I was going to do with the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking around our side, we are so <unk> that we don't even be able to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person remember memory.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we would take just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am in <unk> Jersey, I was six years old and lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom my child.
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was an balcony that I would give the living room.
And there they were all spending time watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I got married and I came back in a towel -- I all saw me.
And I was like this.
He was <unk> not safe and hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those connections to emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency spends 90 percent of their time under top of their time.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as well as based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museum museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
That's why we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round thing, columns, red brick -- that leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of the property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new new technologies, new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to try and teach ourselves and we got so far away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experiment from <unk> we can swing the <unk> back and over and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the '70s.
We architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add bake and use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend time in the shopping centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there we can create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be the <unk> to French or the Italian.
You may be able to get a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we can create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
We architects feel frustrated and started to swing the <unk> back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new <unk> design techniques we now have new <unk> design techniques, and we find new ways -- some ways that they behave against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
Is the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public and public <unk> were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew in a <unk> when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first one star.
But how is it possible that these forms are <unk> and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around and so quickly we learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, with other leading star.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and finally, we are all photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I was designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this, because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That will never come back to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media <unk> it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get to be in both extremes almost <unk> and <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge, completely new.
I'll show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how architecture thinking.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of us <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people from <unk> and tell you that there's no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and you are no longer a <unk> audience who is not accepts something that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave that by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to another one, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> based on ideas of what it must be a <unk>
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to make.
That means that the buildings will spread to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, it also can serve to do sport or to <unk> or even one can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community united around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we built is what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> spaces, the local libraries and the homes where we formed our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year, and he started walking.
And it makes it a great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that the most likes to do for the moment is look to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
You are laughing and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And when did I think about it?
How is it that we suddenly are okay with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like.
Every month, 10,000 people search for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it has 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just want to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it is beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
What his mom says and his friends, or fellow from school -- they say, you don't know who to believe.
So a video of her, it keeps him on YouTube, and he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave you a <unk> "I'm pretty a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and running teenager, which gets these answers in one of the most vulnerable life stages of life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers in today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that come from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, which is always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes they have and the types of comments that they do.
There is no divide between a living online and real life.
It's really hard to know the difference between what's real or what it's not.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what we have to have had digitally.
What is the highlight of the life of someone in front of what is normal in a solar context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to do with what young people are comparing to.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be very beneficial individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mindfulness effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls would prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for growth as humans and as <unk> society and the field of work development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> arguments in the classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One out of five is not attending classes at all the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of testing, if you don't think you look at it well, specifically if you don't think you're going to be thin, <unk> -- a lower note to the average of your companions who don't care about it as well.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it gives it regardless of what these young men are.
So, for course, to be good of course, we're talking about as you see you not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diet -- not healthy that you can take them to a food disorder as well.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily replaced by the people around them, and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this because of what they make decisions, as the alcohol of alcohol and drug consumption, diets -- aesthetic surgery and sex and old ages and no protection and damage and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't have a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, which is that opportunity?
It will give us this potential is for interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first is we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children is not just going to have a positive impact, but it's also a peace impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six ways are crucial points for anybody willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is a fundamental education, but addressing this problem requires each of us to take the develops in the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the status of how women are seen and I talked about our circles.
It's not good to count with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the <unk> of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by making it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and for businesses, to change our culture, for our children to grow up to grow their whole person, value <unk> diversity, <unk>
We have to put people that really making the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see you will never be <unk> of being those who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in your mind?
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
He <unk> his <unk>
It could just be the woman who is at two seats a distance. What would it mean for her if it was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, he would leave him for not to have long legs -- he would get more <unk> a more little <unk> shirt -- little <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this and it would cause his potential to be that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> all of us.
But let's give our children the truth.
I think that the way you look at is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
It took self-esteem to self-esteem in our schools.
So let's switch every one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, become safe change agents in the same morning.
So let's do it.
On November 5 of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense Act.
We initially thought about it, as innocent were, but being prisoner on the other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning to plan attacks to about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
And luckily, those plans will become <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, they would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being he an engineer <unk> with a <unk> American mother, a junior high school professor, among the two made everything possible for giving me a happy childhood teacher.
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to know.
And so I saw that when people take time to interact with it, it doesn't require a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in every human group, there's always a small fraction of the people who were going to become so close to their convictions that they think we need to use all the means possible for everybody to live like them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he was told that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to run on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to point at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially me, all of the goal left on fire.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
And all of all, the comment gave them a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
These people later would be convicted by putting a van <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the southern tower of the World Trade Center, causing a blast killed six people and hurt to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone was now time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often victim <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
So for these reasons I didn't have social skills, to be able to say <unk> for <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> <unk> judge people, based on <unk> <unk> like race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put my test to test my thinking, it was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the <unk> National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a <unk> victim almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids we had done that we had done -- was Jewish.
I took several days to get out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that my whole life had been done to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to try to kind of <unk> people, exactly the way I want to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what is going to be tested by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart got me to be honest with my <unk> and I helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he turned my figure out at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
And at that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, one day, who is about to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path. That even though I was obsessed with this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to speak against those <unk> acts as a rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put myself here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
There is a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> film.
It's 3D in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what they hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film is <unk> tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger -- your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood you project to your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie -- you, you and you.
There's nothing to be <unk>
At least, I know that I have an awareness.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we would get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science is an objective of nature.
<unk> to nature, is subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
So psychology is studying behavioral behavior, and the neuroscience is studying the brain <unk> but nobody ever mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything began to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick as Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to make science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of science work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limits to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind in the fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or to feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas are doing certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
Because it doesn't address the central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it a <unk> movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you may say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon that is emerging as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do the <unk> work -- how do we turn them together, how do they behave and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why this is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm an <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end of the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a wonderful idea, great. We get used to this, the physics explains the chemistry explains chemistry explains the biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to position that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> <unk> before I can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and so it's study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that we left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't tell them in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, you think of principles, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, mass laws of Newton. Then I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws of laws.
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, mass, no load, then for a matter of logic, there are a list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden is not an object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness, the laws that connect awareness to other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, biological processes.
Now, physicists are sometimes saying that we want fundamental laws that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental fundamental laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws they are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> by the mind, not only humans, not only humans, and dogs, the flies, the flies -- even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or they will be.
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when he thinks <unk> travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude sense -- it would be given some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information, there is consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human, human awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration integration, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a half a means of generating information, just quite significant, degree of awareness.
But when it comes to the microbes, microbes particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of a different awareness level.
Indeed, a fundamental law law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies it.
As Stephen Hawking, is where the fire comes from?
From the view, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do essentially describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is that he puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
This vision of vision, I think, is the potential for <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical consequences quite serious ethical and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not have to eat anything that was <unk> then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think I would think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact that consciousness, but their importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
And the vision of the information <unk> she has a complicated processing processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have quite serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of smart computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for collective collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a collective consciousness -- an inner movie for this entire TED group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most confident of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing, which is universal.
Now, vision raises many questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right way towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for this overnight.
But I think we will finally be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile. It's a under education.
I went to school, I joined my friends, <unk> me with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a community in the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful but there is an obvious problem.
She was actually not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my school, and I spent a lot of time looking at <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered if we take the disability out of the equation.
I was years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the classroom just after about 20 minutes, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about <unk> law for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had experienced experiences with disabled people as an inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the <unk> of the boy, it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I am on this stage that I do in this <unk> stage, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you were lying in relation to disability.
Yes, they have been sold to be the lie that disability is something <unk> A on a capital factor.
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and it does not make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hands of the hands in drawing with a pen in the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with dense legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we hired the disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, so bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that they've been approached by strange <unk> expressing that believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images, these images will be involved with disabled people with disabled people without disabilities.
They're there so that you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually hard.
So we had a few things.
But the things that we displaced are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was told by the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we are more than because of the society we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of its ability to do that as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> says it like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us exceptional together.
And honestly, you don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all times.
And yet, I don't think I am fortunate than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  It <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery from the mobile phone battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disabilities.
A lot of smiles before a stack of stairs hasn't done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> for people <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turning those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a age of 15 years old, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have to be so low expectations of the people with disability to get up from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user users.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about to know about it that you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not augmented fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear the glasses of Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would relate to your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the field of play to 160 percent, blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds made us trying to do it with everything his being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I put some videos to show you what the Google is using the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices, because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine rising to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment I would take a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> from <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue Go! Go!
Chris <unk> This is about a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and they've been asked on YouTube and in <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get rid of them, how we get to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which is probably a lot of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, sorry.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when you put a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before he running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> by launching the ball to the network?
What would be their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 times as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the <unk> of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when I <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore would put him a <unk> to her <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed <unk> on the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player going back to your group and you see your next step, shown you in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game to play the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from how high people are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already been working on.
And all that information will send your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
You will have information <unk>
This is going to take the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just to nerds.
It's also going to be <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the <unk> of field.
You put the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will be <unk> that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the system of the <unk> <unk>
It <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there's an open receptor.
He <unk> the <unk> but you get away.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land though, the receptor sees in their bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The audience is <unk> and <unk> have followed the play from each angle.
This is something to create massive excitement in the party.
And I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be their favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of a sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show somebody how it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much this technology is worth for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad it is from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face would be, as always, as usual.
Thank you.
I was reminded recently, after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the end of those 23 years, the southern tip of the county is <unk> which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful views.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer commissioned to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test.
The suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel among the two towers will take the other dimension, this bridge has <unk> as that, so that each of it frees you from all the concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is breaking bones, and some of which we have vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that I don't normally go into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this method of suicide will notice the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, about the two towers, there is 32 inches of parallel steel in the bridge.
This is where most people have to get before they take their lives.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking with a prime officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on July 22, last year when I was receiving a call from a suicide subject sitting in the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason had only 32 years old and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about one hour of talking to <unk> I wondered if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy, kind and clever kid in New Jersey had had just to take a living.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> damage affects a ton of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it <unk>
What do you find?
What does it mean?
In my experience, there's not just to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels because you probably don't know.
You just get there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
It was <unk> to the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, to believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but I am more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and they were terrified of as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as disappeared as we disappeared at night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car from Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness I'd seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you so much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before bad without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
<unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio called by a potential suicide bomber on the sidewalk near the northern tower.
I took my motorcycle down and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he was stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the next year, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided by her account that day will come back to that lane and give it to life another opportunity.
When Kevin did, he <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he <unk> and gave it to hope and life else <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
And you stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to give it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th on March 11 and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
It was going to be told to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like it says.
We give God for you.
I had no debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And in the end, she writes <unk> <unk> when I visited the General Hospital in San Francisco, that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and of their depression that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got caught with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, I would have to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, would not think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Out of those incidents I've been directly involved in -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke to him about an hour.
And during that time, I got my hand in three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Moreover, those few people who have jumped on the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the railing the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be able to use it to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but on your interior you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you get into that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that eventually I had achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
So for reasons why I would go over later when I look at this picture, and I think, we got it out, we got it <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just starting.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the color of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> when I was born because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wear this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but we now know that it's actually something more complex and mystery and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never loved myself to share my story, not because I thought I'm a bad thing, but how the world is all about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day.
I have mama, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came out to me, and I remember that moment as if something got to me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman -- I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a beauty <unk> competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the mandatory spending of <unk> and he agreed. And that night, I won in a bathroom, I won in <unk> and he was <unk> in the top of 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was from Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess of everything when they were <unk> to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you gave you to the United States -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities, in some of the most rural cities, do the surgeries more sophisticated and secure.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before they changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power or power to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was born, he was living his truth, but that he was doing, he made her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 November, we make a global vigil for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my life alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
<unk> <unk> Sure. They first thank you all of my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women who have gone to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when I was called, and they told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, and I took the phone, called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, others don't. It's just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to the birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the topic that sometimes a block was that sometimes that week, not block, and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. All right. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, to the parents who are often met with their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known to her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> his efforts in 2011, when the <unk> National <unk> prize was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when we were born, a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome by his father, nor for her mother.
And then the neighborhood comes back to the mother, and no one would give the father.
And a mother <unk> a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, <unk> gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only did the mother have lost mother, but the daughter was just <unk> as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and school admits of her brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
It can be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it was 13 years old, you have to get out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls in their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family, and if you were to take the code of that of course honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not just affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
I'm supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
That's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of their father and mother and the <unk> decisions and the <unk> even if they don't want to.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if I read it with an old man -- he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> was very young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more and more <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle goes up and goes on.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, trust me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought about her name, and he was fascinated by a <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I got a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when I was four and a half and a half years old, I read it in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One worker at school means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them was able to go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when we were <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters and his daughters, I thought it had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I would just sit down with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to hold it in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys at the same way.
I used education for <unk>
My daughters, taught students, forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women in all of political and economic activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he was lifted up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog in the BBC, was offered her himself for the New York Times, and I talked to each platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell my ear to my wife and "I've got <unk> so he happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
It <unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of peace, and by the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would come up so much for me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains, and very strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that ran out of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to be <unk> "I'm fine with my smile, and with my <unk> in my face.
I'm going to do it well. Please not <unk>
It was comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and we have learned from her how to resist at the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like every 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when he does not finish his task.
He was fighting with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain about 18 years ago, and from that day, science science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking today about here about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to an operation of brain.
Are you still as smart or not?
Is it not going to be like that, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how many of a dozen different chemicals of chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations of the combinations of chemicals, and try to convince them to stay alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try and get them to try and get the dose of <unk> because you really don't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes on the dose of the dose would dramatically get my sense of who I was me, my sense of who I think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried dose and different chemicals for a man, and I was surprised by looking at how my thoughts <unk>
I was always <unk> I was thinking all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, so many times in the past I've met various types of guys like this, or maybe some versions of the past.
It turned out as an end.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave myself a new appreciation for men and what they have to <unk> since then I carry on with men.
What I was trying to do is make the hormones and neurotransmitters and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my sense of ideas.
<unk> to think about almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, which is a simple one, for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really very sophisticated and good <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images out of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a movie director would be able to use its imagination only to steer the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty trying to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're quite close to get to this with two recent experiments that were made by two groups leading into neuroscience.
Both of these used active technology is an functional fMRI picture, to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan that was done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks an image.
The column in the middle shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual while you're looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from <unk> <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of reactions in the brain to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new people, new animals, and while they were <unk> a new <unk>
And the computer, using just the brain data from the scanning <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We are well close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you see that same picture, you can think of the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the major brain scanning systems, available today, and their resolution was exploded as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of you are proposing new projected techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we have to ask ourselves the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom is that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were just to make magnets really big, right?
And yet, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> radio rates in MRI systems in MRI.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field, they will ignore magnetic patterns <unk> <unk> radio patterns <unk>
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns, we can dramatically increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide ourselves into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid, but the hormones and the hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more options than opening up this door.
But anyway, pick one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His wish maybe to tell someone for the first time you would love or say to someone who is pregnant, or telling somebody who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have in your life.
And so I have a tough conversation, and even though our topics can vary <unk> the experience of I've experienced and have come out of that closet is universal thing.
It is fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave me a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my short pants and my head was very little, I would often ask me a child to say, "Hey, you're a kid or a <unk>
And there'd be uncomfortable on the table.
I put my jaw a little closer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would say nothing and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> quotes <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took the deep down and I went down and I went down and my backs and my backs of four years old with pink dress staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You are <unk>
And so I took a deep distance back again, I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is messy.
I have the short hair like one guy, and I have a little boy, and you see a girl, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl from a ninja pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all of it. They were just a girl. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the hard conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yeah, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how a feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not unlike yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why I was going to come out of my closet was harder to come out of his, but this is the <unk> It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared on banking banking is harder than I say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I tell is harder than telling your five-year-old son that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's just the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to deal with how hard to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may make sense security, or at least what you offer the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, one dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant gay gay <unk> to fight every four year-old boy who would come up with coffee.
I was frozen by the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay grenade <unk> and moving only a muscle is the best scary thing ever done.
My family, my whole friends, with the ones I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my more memorable hats was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests were, they knew that it was gay, and when I made my own lady <unk> in my black and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me years ago.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women I stood in, <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who we were <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show desperately how your support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
That's how hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anybody who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl of the <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves going out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl on the coffee I didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others need to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know.
If they say to your parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be <unk> for that.
And some of you can get wounded that they are going to be hurt by what they've done, but I'm never talking about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours -- your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet I wish you all have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very enough, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen the intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is so interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we had a program to try and understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's step back a step.
We first start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as a <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about the Earth of the Earth, would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question than understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So on this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be honed adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, to development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning planning planning. There have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of future accessible, Yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to remain <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the options open.
And so, having in account this equation, is a question: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It <unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator:
But what happens if that <unk> <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more inclusive relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlates with production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes out of it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system in any system that you can meet inside.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal intelligence tests -- play games, and even make money -- <unk> actions, all of them without being able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling off just the opposite tips of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see this successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly moving, and they keep successful the network right here.
This same capacity of <unk> network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of online actions, successfully by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk of risk management will have vast applications in finance, insurance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and and our social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term the term -- robot, <unk> -- there was always the concept that if you were using smart machines, there would be a rebellion <unk>
Machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of rebellion, <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines are getting smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask me, how is it that we look for targets all of these <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help you build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, it is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge to how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, that orbit around other stars, what points to Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the acoustic intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they captured a little bit of that light that will go.
The data gathered by Kepler -- they show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their star star.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth <unk> of our solar system, and also the amount of light that receive from their own.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us since millennia now is disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale, have rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet being influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I look for alien opportunities in the sector.
Now, as a lot of people are interested in finding life in the universe in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the very first discovered planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and partly that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface to look for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> satellites like the <unk> mission to take samples from the atmosphere -- and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that we still stay in <unk> places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most extreme and tallest places on Earth is fresh and teeming with oxygen <unk> by our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets will take a great and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief of some that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable Earth.
For a long way, I think I think I'm deep in my space exploration, I'm deep with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to give humanity to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will have place later in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to understand and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces that are going to be able to grow up in hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we could satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with a <unk> experiment.
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the alien life existence so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to be able to consider to live between the stars, lose the notion of how important the planets is to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's kind of arrogant to think that only <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to deal with hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window out of the dining table, where I had <unk> them.
So fast I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and all were closed out.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because he had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was afraid of my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure they don't get a <unk> at the middle of a half night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was very <unk>
I'm neurologist a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rate, and you get the adrenaline levels and <unk> thought.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in its place, which was going to be bad things going on.
Or at least, if bad things happen.
So I started thinking about that, but even a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> and a little embarrassed he told him about holding the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called hindsight retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Whenever there is a disaster, a team of experts comes out and trying to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as he explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then try to figure out what can we do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious ones.
In the house, we would take a place for the things that are pretty easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk> works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are facing trees <unk> where the female tribes live, and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows <unk> to find their nuts.
And if somebody really asked if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and still they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that they move very much.
This is the reason for losing your car glasses and <unk>
So in the house, a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport.
For your glasses of reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it that your stuff will always be there when you get them.
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards a picture of your credit card, license, you stop themselves so that they are in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a loved person, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all making medical decisions, and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol result is a little <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack on the heart stroke.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today.
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for that most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And it must think of what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not guilt guilt about the doctor, and if it's guilt for somebody like me.
We haven't quite understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help one person?
Haiti.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers who <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before you avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you probably think, "Okay, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, let's get out of the <unk> effects. Right?
For this particular medicine, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things like <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think of how you look at this over time, so you don't have to make the crisis of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that you can help your medicine.
I don't say that they should not take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
National medical ethics is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that you do more in the biggest men in the age of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make up the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a <unk> life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think of now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react quickly. They might be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a while.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent things bad in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in Montreal when I returned from my journey, my contractor I settled on a <unk> along with the door, with a key from the door to the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I've not read.
So I am not so valuable, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: This is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more smoothly.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree from <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands of thousands and thousands of <unk> can never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American <unk> system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs of French signs came over over the <unk> and over time, it mixed with local signs, and the language of the language we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But I'm now realizing that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a world of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country, follow blindly rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure the <unk> in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, of which it's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to keep going.
<unk> <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
Yet for me, to make it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be that way.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that not only do you experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency <unk>
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could take it to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me to be <unk>
I chose <unk>
There's massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same as and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with lots of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you wouldn't continue to have this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic new artistic <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as well as the signals as well.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano to understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If it's <unk> a different parameter for each finger as it hits the piano, as the facial expression movement, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so as it hits the piano, English is a linear language, as if it was <unk> just one key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a concept of clear or idea.
If only one key <unk> would create a completely different meaning completely different.
The same thing happens to music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters that can be expressing different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk>
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
<unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I got to think, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk> lens.
If I had to create a sign and fold it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the <unk> sign that the sun comes out and gets in.
This is all day."
If you look at it, and <unk> the speed of speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All of the <unk>
This is all night at this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
And yet, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> <unk> <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of your hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of your hands on top.
Now we're going to do it as much on my head like your chest something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, it's a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third thing, please.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job. Good job.
Now look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they make very different meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving just like the music.
Yet today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have the sounds, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, and I don't have to hear about learning about music.
The <unk> is a rich treasure. and I'd like to have the same experience.
I'd like to show you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "Can you get all of all, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults lied to us to protect ourselves from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also have <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up the other ones.
The country, I'm now adult and I teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans, they contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And over the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we have this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's also too risky to use those huge boats here.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years old, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I let my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
So by using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids will get a lot of with robots.
And then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And then we turned light and chambers in toes, and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a <unk> estimate of the number of plastic in water.
I took this invention step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would push it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> they're trying to fix it right away.
I'm able to investigate my problem <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, the Internet is <unk> and they get <unk> with this image: right?
A child, maybe lower than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is affecting the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil is also in brown color and when it's <unk> it's very difficult to see what is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be traced through all kinds of substances that make different <unk> that can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in remote to other children.
I research a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe I would address a harder problem and also closer to me.
I'm Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started up several giant waves and called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the East coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear central power plant to water.
And today, according to reports by average reports are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation radiation, everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the majority of the time, it has quite safe, blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It may seem that they didn't take the seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them, we discussed the data that comes out that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to render data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this, we were able to notice that radioactive dust will spread from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the nearest nuclear central war to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of nuclear power, and with the fishing aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> trying to sediment it as we invented and built.
So here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the jump, and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the biggest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal wood, chemistry, a bit of biology, of optical fibers, you can actually build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair wheelchair in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So that scientists, <unk> creators, we have to prepare for the next generation to be concerned with the environment and people, and so it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made out of thousands of steel, the other one <unk> <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One <unk> on the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble <unk> he saw a figure that will fight for free.
The <unk> was a single tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information that was required for each cell to work and to do it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of objects as a <unk> of parts of parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that takes gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world <unk> the double personality of every designer and an architect to work currently between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and synthetic analytics are shown in two screens after me.
My work, at the most simple level, try to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask you why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, an unusual moment, where they make four discipline that offers designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scales, of a large scale, like this <unk> robotic arm in diameter with a basic basis that one day is not very far to print buildings, and graphics on the nanoscale made of genetically engineered microorganisms in the darkness.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient architecture, and has created a screen where each highlights is only size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they're like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high <unk> analytical instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural structural structural and also that absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to nature for <unk> and when designing this <unk> pattern, it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them stayed and to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God send her Earth to grow a tree that was <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, which is 11 and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with twigs, <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if the objects came out of a single piece?
Do you go to a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material that is <unk> the kind of material of the tree of the tree and fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year because of organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We did a bunch of husks of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we produced toothpaste <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material in the march and create these structures made of one three and a half a half a half recyclable material.
When the pieces are ready, it dry up to find a natural shape in the air.
So why are we still designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first arose on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and make it sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of <unk> to mesh, and if it broadens even more again.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure that was made of shrimp husks in an architecture that acts like a tree.
And here is the best part: for these things that are designed for <unk> <unk> life and put on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same exploration of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the board, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals are <unk> new biological features inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you will get two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light to sugar, the other you take sugar and produce biofuels to the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, not interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like <unk> tract -- which will help you make these bacteria and to make it <unk> their way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, and we can put the properties of material in terms of the material of <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we had more transparent.
This <unk> digestive system when you stretch out of one end to another 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels <unk> brilliant channels inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are typical <unk> creatures only half a <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that make matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the skin tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit in biology.
I call this a material ecology.
And for that, you always have to go back to nature.
So you know a 3D printer in layers.
It also knows that nature does not do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It's done by the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first place in the environment, creates a tension, structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, glue a small magnet to the head of an silk worm -- to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put silk worm on a flat, not within a box, we realized that he <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of the entire way, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape <unk> silk without boiling <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms will be more dark and <unk> and so we use this solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat it goes into the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
<unk> silk worms to a online silk station.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they were <unk> and the life starts again, and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more cuts.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> they give all this whole canopy across it.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give products to products and the buildings around us to form a form of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which takes us back around, of course, at the beginning.
So here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by the nature of an inspired nature of design, which demands for us, for the first time, we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be about <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
Can you touch with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be about <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer to the question, "What do you want to be about <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and developed websites -- also, playing guitar in a rock band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this sense of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I went through the other thing, which is totally different, and I was going to focus on it, and I let me absorb and feel like I feel <unk> I've found <unk> and then again, this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried to have fear of commitment, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
So what we can do is where you learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where the <unk> learned about culture.
Do you first ask yourself, "Do you want to be <unk>
And when we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what it was going to be.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> students are going to be asked by high school students are going to pick up at university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be about <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you take off the dream.
Why?
If this question inspired children to dream about what they might be, not inspires to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it just does the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, but adults are going to be <unk> maybe they would be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> Amy magazine turned into <unk> <unk> professor and creative leaders.
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is focused on our culture.
It's this idea of fate or true <unk> the idea that each of us has something to spend during their time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and spend your life on it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that come up with curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk> to say.
It could help if you divide in three parts: a little bit of potential <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms of terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
And during the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Do you think of any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of <unk> to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or a <unk> that you must win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more and more creation and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, traveling math and design, to found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
From there is the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower, is learning fast.
When we <unk> we <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it has been many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try to try and get out of our comfort zones.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a full time <unk> and an independent man.
As a child, I had an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the smallest sales of short-term sales when they started their thumb, and this ability to write compelling pieces for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to go to what you would tell you, even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It's the ability to turn it into whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the CEO of other websites, sometimes consultant of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company Company as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to engage the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to themselves.
We have a complex problem -- we think of right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart.
<unk> the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers an understanding of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that we're going to interact with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them are being told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once he said this, if there's one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the <unk> <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then <unk> all media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep up with those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> he took a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until she passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more surprising.
If you were to have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer. <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progressed in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's of a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to the age 85 or more, the chance to get Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your years is going through with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or dear to Alzheimer's.
Already only in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs of costs -- a five-year rise in 2050, by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little done for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death causes all of the world, Alzheimer's percent is the only one that cannot be solved to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's percent, despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and cause a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everybody <unk> Alzheimer's disease, is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us -- all of us -- even, scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy brain brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger severe memory loss and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly longer life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left in the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots and a lot of steps, and identifying what a bomb.
You can do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that I do.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, <unk> physical, physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that collectively block this way to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest outcomes.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are your healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick into each other, as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stages, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result: but the research as this shows Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there is real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more R&D research and pharmaceutical industry in scientists and <unk>
That was essential to advance in HIV treatment at the late '80s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too much <unk> to come out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases of a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients as a <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the spine in the New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience to test it myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will get rid of 36 questions, more and more personal questions, and then both of you look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow in a quality or a skill, what would that be?
Number two: When was the last time you ever heard another person?
And <unk>
It's actually <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to call it or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've never met.
When I first came across this study a few years ago, one detail really struck me attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
And yet, we had a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column that I send it to the column that I send out for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you might probably ask yourself, keep in all of them yet.
And the reason I think that you challenge this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had helped me write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just of my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that has a good job burden in a relatively new relationship.
But as I was given there was no idea.
The paper ran on a Friday night, and then on Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I'd already called the Machine Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing about <unk> experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they would first ask, still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international business, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> that included the readers of the readers to test the study with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both made a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> photos of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> <unk> process -- a range of which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, especially people said the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going to go together or not, and then <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for <unk> protocol among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants were closer and closer to doing that several studies, and they were also used by <unk> protocol -- as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people in the opposite policy people.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, he was cited in this article, but unfortunately he never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say you're going to tell you about the person who was <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that I did get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
He had had that relationship since I had 20, which was almost almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went to science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could be a certain form of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just did this for the book I was writing about, but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I sat back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or another.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more trust in demanding what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably as you can demand me.
What I look for love is an operation, not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that I will continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk, and this is a very scary story, because in love with us makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that is, still follow together?
And his content with a reply response, or No.
So more than a question, let's ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get rid of it, and how to figure out when to cut and cut <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the question of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we kept <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it is not true, but because at the time, there was no thought that that choice was.
I didn't think I was going to think of how many times we would take that decision, and how sometimes I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, I have chosen to love somebody so generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice on the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is turning my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what we're going to do, and what I may spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy ending implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also would love me, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> in full mountain, and in some ways I came up as a <unk> of the forest.
And in New York City a while.  One thing that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'm eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar, a <unk> and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and <unk> and all of those things I was <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a <unk> <unk> and I was <unk> by the style -- Agnes covered the resin of resin and a bee stayed <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to be the opposite: somehow it seemed like it grew up as a size, as if it was that they put the text with a <unk>
So I did I build more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic and strange bottles that was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow up, drawing the same thing that you do about a <unk> on the crime scene.
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend over for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point I became interested in human form sculptures of natural sizes with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to drawing on a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using it.
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with head of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where the creatures with <unk> animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform -- the <unk> in Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and spits out oil in a hand while in the other hand, you get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird peak.
It also has a <unk> tail, a long tail line that binds the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into fire on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> made from terrorist cards.
They've been <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
These are like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting a few years.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 kilos with a human being trapped inside.
This is a small cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's his chest, and it can be <unk>
I'm going to play it for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of their chest, and that covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it is -- a kind of thing that has been <unk>
It's a quick refresher from these works because I can't take it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue coming in.
There's a small forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> as the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a radio, a <unk> a school, an editorial arm that spreads the entire content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in the way hits each other with each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together on this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, of the borders, of religion doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start sharing those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first passes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> system for any drug you can have an effect on the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are <unk> they serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the patient's account.
But they are also known for their side effects of <unk> in most of the negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the current -- your blood will be <unk> and worse for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's most important -- in the HIV collapse.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it does not easily go into the blood stream of patients that would be transferred to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment treatment of the way they run out of it.
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, <unk> to get treatment directly into the virus warehouse without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you are used in <unk> to support of wounds and surgery surgery, they can be used for anything <unk> including shipping drug transportation.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes, which opens up and closing almost immediately the infected cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little powerful beam of laser membrane on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains medicine.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> at the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to go to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this is not a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research from the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups as terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
What these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to violent confrontation, not violent.
I do the field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of political conflict process.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do that, but no one looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed fight and the policies not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980's, <unk> has also established a political party and a social service network and military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking it.
We put a complex machinery in communication and radio stations, radio channels TV -- websites on the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the journal <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups do something else: they create stronger ties to their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an protected Afghanistan by the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be tested in the efforts of these groups by providing security groups.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high European price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the victory election from 2006 of Palestinian Hamas could not be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex setting, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill in <unk> gaps by government, and come up with armed and politicians, participate in the violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated things are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something else to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of the ground, they run all of their <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the weaker how many of the states, like in the Middle East, the more <unk> and they fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in a military tools.
<unk> that governance vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors, actors, the military power can win some fights, but we won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals -- we need long-term investments to fill that security, of security, to fill that out of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair to <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I would tell me as a bad feminist feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women -- these women <unk> with the men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and in anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist.
It will be labeled a feminist age, a bad word and nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually the woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They had the same job for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it to be easy and accessible the contraceptives and services are <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to look at our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have to account for these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist feminist.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I listen to rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and my offends me -- the classic <unk> <unk> <unk> the yin -- yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> actually with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> for my music.
I believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make them happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, it's your election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, they agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes vulnerable to vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
This problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color, gay workers and <unk> for white, white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist feminism ...
It also happens this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put psychologists <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that you will have perfection.
When we get to the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself from that <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative people and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as a <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that <unk> is afraid not to be able to fulfill the slightly realistic expectations of it.
Let's take <unk> or as I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist feminist now.
In the <unk> Music University in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to look at this star of pop <unk> openly feminism and trying to know women and young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics were starting endless arguments if it was to be or not a feminist matter.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much.
We're going far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more good, a <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to action and be a bit more <unk>
If I hear music music, I am creating an demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> change effectively affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
Where they were being surprised by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the movie in another part when movies are not trying to make women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop support to professional sports where athletes treat their peers as sacks of <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, engage in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage participate in these kinds of projects, we can also adapt it to being even more like us to be empowered to overcome the barriers to private decision-making.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these <unk> efforts to adopt these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in the power of directors and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim to courage with courage -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids were excited when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't believe me to believe I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and wonder, I also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear and see me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I hold the story that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need to be a bit courageous, when you need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, I spent children in California had <unk> having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most possible diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak of <unk> they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that controversy about autism and <unk> vaccines and <unk> and <unk> by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world remain <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it create the whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates have continued stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> organizations like <unk> <unk> are routinely routinely referred to autism as an epidemic as if it could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control on Atlanta what's happening, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better detection detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of their two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told the story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital was published in an article that describes 11 young patients who looked at 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could be fun for hours by shaking hands in their face, but they were prey to panic for <unk> like when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in subject, declared had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned nine out of 10 children to his office to his office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've kept in a fridge in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their <unk> parents to win their approval from.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive cognitive psychologist, I thought the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like black-eyed Susie! without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend for the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a prevalence study of autism in the general population.
I was an suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was, I quit clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as he said <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of the data.
How did no one ever realize about these kids before?
But then I found a reference to a paper that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation to English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he was <unk> and he <unk> it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning learning were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic, they started with music exercises with music, and children followed their games on Sunday, for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described described as a <unk> disability of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, having called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of methods that were particularly suited to them.
And so Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of dexterity and disabilities.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and has always been, looking at aspects of this continuous <unk> of <unk> culture like the awkward social scientist and the professor <unk>
He was more there even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as that the parents were the <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria for diagnostic Association that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and principles of the '90s, their changes turned into <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a broad management model for a broad management model.
These changes didn't look at the <unk>
<unk> when he <unk> and Judith working between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition -- with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, <unk> and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, the first very simple clinical trials are introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that this was out there, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming the vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a simple, powerful, credible story like <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of the prevention of every 68 children in the United States are on the spectrum, it's right, the autistic groups are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea that puzzles are so puzzles to solve through new medical breakthroughs -- the <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most traditional aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities communities and fathers with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we walked into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
